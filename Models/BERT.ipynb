       " 'Stock futures pulled back slightly Monday evening after a record-setting session.\\n\\nEach of the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq rallied to fresh highs on Monday as more corporate earnings results exceeded expectations and defied concerns over ongoing supply chain constraints, shortages and cost pressures.\\n\\nClorox (CLX) became one of the latest major names to top estimates in results posted Monday after the closing bell, with the cleaning supplies and home goods company topping third-quarter sales and profits estimates and reaffirming its full-year guidance even as the company said it expects \"cost pressures to persist.\" Shares of Avis (AVIS) and Simon Property Group (SPG) also jumped, with both of these companies posting quarterly earnings that exceeded expectations after market close.\\n\\nHeading into this week, the expected earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 was at 36.6% for the third quarter, which while a step down from the second quarter\\'s rate, would still mark the third-highest pace in data spanning back to 2010, according to FactSet.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think what\\'s going on is terribly surprising,\" when it comes to the sizable year-over-year earnings growth many companies have reported for the third quarter, Pacer ETF\\'s President Sean O\\'Hara told Yahoo Finance Live. \"I think what we need to see going forward is, is it sustainable, or are some of these outside factors going to be a bigger challenge than we expect?\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"Is inflation and the input costs that the producers are dealing with, is that going to derail things? Is the lack of workers?\" he added. \"There\\'re a lot of things out there that could potentially derail the market, especially as you\\'re making this transition from where we are, which is easy comparables versus last year, to more difficult ones going forward.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the solid backdrop of corporate earnings, an ongoing economic recovery and still-accommodative positioning by monetary policymakers have also helped underpin equities in their march to new highs. For investors, the Federal Reserve\\'s latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday will help suggest how long the central bank will maintain its current levels of support. Many pundits expect to see the bank begin to pull back the asset purchases that comprised its quantitative easing program that had helped support the recovery, with fresh economic data reflecting a U.S. economy closing in on pre-pandemic conditions.\\n\\n\"We think that better days are ahead. Earnings are still growing at a pretty healthy clip. There\\'s a lot of people focusing on peak growth rates. That\\'s probably not the way to look at it,\" Sameer Samana, Wells Fargo senior global market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live. \"From our standpoint, those low interest rates, still stimulative policy and really strong growth are what set the stage for strong equities in the next year.\"\\n\\n—\\n\\n6:07 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures edge lower\\n\\nHere\\'s where markets were trading as the overnight session kicked off:\\n\\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F): -2 points (-0.04%), to 4,603.75 Dow futures (YM=F): -18 points (-0.05%), to 35,8782.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): -16.25 points (-0.1%) to 15,878.00 A street sign for Wall Street is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., July 19, 2021.

       " 'Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks quickly dives into the broader market and where things stand to start November. The focus then shifts to three blue-chip technology stocks to consider buying as stocks hit new highs on strong earnings, resilient American consumers, and more.\\n\\nAll three major U.S. indices broke records in October during a resurgent month for stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 9% last month, the S&P 500 jumped over 7%, and the Dow popped roughly 6%. All three then hit new highs on Monday to start November trading.\\n\\nThe forward-looking market shrugged off slow Q3 GDP growth and other concerns in favor of the positives. The improving earnings picture includes everyone from tech giants to Ford F. The S&P 500 margins outlook also remains strong for 2022 and beyond, despite rising pricing and supply chain bottlenecks (also read: Even Big Tech Has Supply Chain Problems).\\n\\nPlus, the consumer-driven U.S. economy flashed comeback signs in the first month of the fourth quarter, from hotel occupancy to restaurant dining. And consumer confidence increased in October, after three months of declines, which is a great sign for the economy as we enter the heart of the holiday shopping period.\\n\\nWall Street will also be left chasing returns in equities\\xa0for the foreseeable future even when the Fed finally starts to raise its core interest rate. Therefore, investors with long-term outlooks might want to consider buying strong stocks they plan to hold for a while, even though the market could face some near-term selling pressure after the strong October run pushed things to some overheated technical levels.\\n\\nThe first stock up is Microsoft MSFT. The historic technology firm continues to benefit from the expansion of the booming cloud computing market. MSFT topped our Q1 estimates last week and it overtook Apple AAPL as the world’s most valuable company after its post-release climb.\\n\\nSalesforce CRM shares have surged to new highs and its growing portfolio of work-focused software offerings help it stand out in a crowded, yet vital industry. Last up is creative and business software powerhouse Adobe ADBE.

       " \"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\\n\\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\\n\\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\\n\\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this software maker a great growth pick right now.\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Microsoft is 24.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 15.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.6%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Microsoft is 26.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 15.2%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 19.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.4%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Microsoft. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.5% over the past month.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nMicrosoft has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nThis combination indicates that Microsoft is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Microsoft has gained 49.1% since the start of the year compared to the 25.8% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 41.8% return for the Zacks Computer - Software industry.\\n\\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\\n\\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 26, 2021, Microsoft reported EPS of $2.27 versus consensus estimate of $2.06 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.29%.\\n\\nFor the current fiscal year, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $9.19 per share on $194.88 billion in revenues. This represents a 15.31% change in EPS on a 15.94% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $10.16 per share on $220.41 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.61% and 13.1%, respectively.\\n\\nValuation Metrics\\n\\nMicrosoft may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\\n\\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\\n\\nMicrosoft has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\\n\\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 36.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 34.5X versus its peer group's average of 28.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nZacks Rank\\n\\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\\n\\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Microsoft meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Microsoft shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\\n\\nHow Does Microsoft Stack Up to the Competition?\\n\\nShares of Microsoft have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Weibo (WB), Shutterstock (SSTK), and CACI International (CACI), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Microsoft, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       " 'By Elizabeth Culliford\\n\\n(Reuters) - Facebook changed its name last week to Meta Platforms Inc to signal its focus on the metaverse, which it thinks will be the successor to the mobile internet.\\n\\nThe metaverse broadly refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.\\n\\nWell before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\\'s splashy demos featuring giant robots and digital time travels to ancient Rome, dozens of companies were crafting the software and hardware that could be used for this \"Ready Player One\" future.\\n\\nThe concept, which could be more than a decade away from being fully realized, will take cooperation among tech giants. In June, investment firm Roundhill Investments created an exchange traded fund (ETF) to track and profit from the work of the metaverse enablers. Hours before Facebook announced its rebrand, another firm launched its own metaverse ETF.\\n\\nHere are a few of companies playing a role:\\n\\nROBLOX\\n\\nVideo game platform Roblox Corporation, which went public this year, envisions the metaverse as a place where \"people can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create and socialize.\"\\n\\nRoblox aims to give users and developers ways to create digital worlds. Its CEO has also talked about future shopping and conducting business on the platform, which has its own virtual economy powered by its Robux currency.\\n\\nMICROSOFT\\n\\nMicrosoft Corp\\'s CEO Satya Nadella in an earnings call this year said the company was working to build an \"enterprise metaverse\" as the digital and physical worlds converge in its offerings.\\n\\nMicrosoft, which owns Xbox and the world-building game Minecraft, is also a key player in the gaming world. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has talked about planning for \"a metaverse or mixed-reality construct.\"\\n\\nFACEBOOK\\n\\nFacebook, which will start trading as Meta Platforms on Dec 1, has said it wants to be seen as a metaverse company rather than a social media one. The tech giant, which has about 3 billion users, has been investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality and has been building out its VR environment Horizon, accessed through its Quest headsets.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNVIDIA\\n\\nComputer chip maker Nvidia Corp built its Omniverse platform for connecting 3D worlds into a shared virtual universe. It says Omniverse, which is used for projects like creating simulations of real-world buildings and factories, is the \"plumbing\" on which metaverses could be built.\\n\\nUNITY\\n\\nUnity Software Inc, which develops software used to design video games, is another company that could sell tools or technology used to build the metaverse.\\n\\nSNAP\\n\\nSnapchat owner Snap Inc has long been building custom avatars and augmented reality filters to overlay digital features on the real world. This year it unveiled its first true augmented reality glasses, available for developers to experiment with creating experiences for the spectacles.\\n\\nAUTODESK\\n\\nCloud software firm Autodesk makes programs used by architects and engineers to design and create buildings and products. Its software is also used to build virtual worlds for gaming and entertainment.\\n\\nTENCENT\\n\\nChinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd is the world\\'s largest video gaming firm by revenue and has stakes in major game studios like Epic Games and Activision Blizzard. The South China Morning Post reported this year that Tencent has registered many metaverse-related trademarks for its social site QQ.\\n\\nEPIC GAMES\\n\\nEpic is the company behind video game phenomenon Fortnite, which has moved beyond its core shooting game to social experiences like dance parties and virtual music concerts. Users pay to dress their avatars in different costumes and can build their own islands and games. Epic also owns a large gaming engine, Unreal, used to develop games and other visual effects like TV show backdrops.\\n\\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney, a vocal critic of big platforms like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\\'s Google, has argued the metaverse will need to be a participatory, common space.\\n\\nAMAZON\\n\\nEcommerce giant Amazon.com Inc, which is the world\\'s largest cloud services vendor and has multiple media offerings, is also seen as a potential player in the metaverse.\\n\\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford; Editing by Kenneth Li and Cynthia Osterman)',\n",

Sega is exploring making titles with global reach on Microsoft\\'s Azure cloud platform. Microsoft\\'s own major cloud gaming initiative is available via the Xbox Game Pass, a cross-platform subscription service that features Sega titles like the hit \"Yakuza\" series, Reuters reports. Cloud gaming cuts ties to bulky hardware but requires a fast internet connection.

Investors are heading into November trading with momentum from a record-setting October, when the S&P 500 logged its best monthly gain in nearly a year. Each of the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq had set all-time highs last week, powered higher by a combination of estimates-topping corporate profit results. And according to data from LPL Financial, November has marked the best month of the year for stocks over the past 10 years and since 1950.\\n\\nFresh catalysts for the markets are due out later this week. Investors in the coming days will be eyeing a slew of new quarterly earnings results for companies from Clorox (CLX) to CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Lyft (LYFT) and Square (SQ), on the back of what has been an already historically strong earnings season.\\n\\nAs of Friday, just over half of all S&P 500 companies had reported actual third-quarter earnings results, and 82% of these topped consensus estimates on profit results, according to data from FactSet. The expected earnings growth rate for the index is more than 36%, which, if maintained, would mark the third-highest profit growth rate for the index since 2010.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThough some of the heavily weighted index components from last week had disappointed against consensus estimates — with both Amazon and Apple shares dropping after posting weaker-than-expected results and guidance — other stronger results helped offset these misses, with names including Alphabet and Microsoft rallying to record levels on the heels of their respective reports.\\n\\nThis week will also include key economic data reports including the October jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a pick-up in job creation compared to the disappointing pace of hiring shown in each of August and September.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee will convene for its next monetary policy-setting meeting. on Tuesday and Wednesday, then release its policy statement and hold a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This meeting is expected to set the stage for an announcement of tapering of the Fed\\'s crisis-era asset purchase program, which is currently taking place at rate of $120 billion per month in purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities and Treasurys. Amid the improving data tracking the economic recovery, the Fed previously signaled that a tapering announcement would come before year-end, and that the tapering process would continue until the middle of next year.\\n\\nGiven the market has been anticipating the start to tapering for months now, speculation around when the Fed will make a move on interest rates has become a point of particular interest to investors. This week\\'s FOMC statement and press conference are likely to provide some more color to market participants around how committee members are thinking about the timing for interest-rate hikes, especially given the persistent jump in inflation seen in data including last week\\'s core personal consumptions expenditures report. That print showed a fourth straight month with core PCE jumping at 3.6% year-over-year rate, or its fastest since 1991.\\n\\nThese still-heightened inflation data, combined with companies\\' earnings call anecdotes of higher input prices and labor costs, have led some investors to speculate the Fed might need to move to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed to stave off an unchecked and lasting surge in inflation.\\n\\nOthers, however, suggested the Fed might hold off on a move on interest rates until labor market conditions have come closer to pre-pandemic levels.\\n\\n\"Fed funds futures currently price in the first rate hike by September 2022. If realized, that would be much faster than the one-year gap that occurred between the end of the Fed’s asset purchases in December 2014 and its first rate hike in December 2015,\" Sam Bullard, Wells Fargo senior economist, wrote in a note. \"We think the Fed is unlikely to hike rates by September 2022, given that numerous FOMC policymakers have made clear that the bar for a rate hike is much higher than the bar for tapering asset purchases.\"\\n\\n\"At August’s rate of job growth, it would take a little more than two years to recoup 100% of the jobs lost during the pandemic, and even then, the economy would be still several million jobs short of its pre-pandemic trend,\" he added. \"We still expect the labor market to face a meaningful employment gap for the entirety of 2022. As such, we currently have the first rate hike not occurring until 2023. Obviously the economic situation is fluid and risks to the outlook suggest the rate hike could come sooner than we expect. A very close eye needs to be kept on all incoming data.\"\\n\\n—\\n\\n7:22 a.m. ET Monday: Stock futures point to a higher open\\n\\nHere\\'s where markets were trading ahead of the opening bell:\\n\\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F): +21 points (+0.46%), to 4,618.00 Dow futures (YM=F): +176.00 points (+0.49%), to 35,880.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): +63.5 points (+0.4%) to 15,902.00 Crude (CL=F): +$0.46 (+0.55%) to $84.03 a barrel Gold (GC=F): +$0.80 (+0.04%) to $1,784.70 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.6 bps to yield 1.582% Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 27, 2021.

FB and Microsoft Corporation MSFT.\\n\\nEven Big Tech Has Supply Chain Problems\\n\\nA recurring theme this earnings season has been supply-chain woes and shortages of essential inputs, as well as labor, with not even the mighty Apple and Amazon immune from the issues.\\n\\nOf the ‘Big 5’ Tech players – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook & Microsoft– these challenges caused Apple and Amazon to miss estimates, while it was a non-issue for Alphabet and Microsoft. Facebook would have been in the latter camp as well, but it was dealing with some platform-specific issues in the quarter.\\n\\nLooking at this elite group of five ‘Big Tech’ players as a whole, these companies earned $69.1 billion in earnings in the September quarter on $322.1 billion in revenues. This group’s Q3 earnings and revenues are up +32.8% and +25.1% from the year-earlier period, respectively.\\n\\nCurrent consensus expectations for this group for the coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in 2021 Q3 and the preceding period.\\n\\nWhat we see here is that growth is decelerating in a major way, even if we account for some upward revision estimates in the coming days.\\n\\nThis is a very short-term view of this group, as all of these companies are still capable of generating impressive growth by most conventional standards in the long run.\\n\\nWhether the growth trend for these companies is decelerating or not is a function of your holding horizon. These companies are impressive growth engines in the long run.\\n\\nBeyond the big 5 Tech players, total Q3 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole, are expected to be up +30.8% from the same period last year on +16.1% higher revenues.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThis big picture view of the ‘Big 5’ players, as well as the sector as whole shows a decelerating growth trend.\\n\\nThat said, unlike this ‘quarterly view’, the annual picture shows a lot more stability.\\n\\nQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard\\n\\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, October 29th, we now have Q3 results from 279 S&P 500 members or 55.9% of the index’s total membership.

This leaves Microsoft and Apple battling one another to claim the world's largest market cap.\",\n",
       " 'By Elizabeth Culliford\\n\\n(Reuters) - Facebook changed its name last week to Meta Platforms Inc to signal its focus on the metaverse, which it thinks will be the successor to the mobile internet.\\n\\nThe metaverse broadly refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.\\n\\nWell before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\\'s splashy demos featuring giant robots and digital time travels to ancient Rome, dozens of companies were crafting the software and hardware that could be used for this \"Ready Player One\" future.\\n\\nThe concept, which could be more than a decade away from being fully realized, will take cooperation among tech giants. In June, investment firm Roundhill Investments created an exchange traded fund (ETF) to track and profit from the work of the metaverse enablers. Hours before Facebook announced its rebrand, another firm launched its own metaverse ETF.\\n\\nHere are a few of companies playing a role:\\n\\nROBLOX\\n\\nVideo game platform Roblox Corporation, which went public this year, envisions the metaverse as a place where \"people can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create and socialize.\"\\n\\nRoblox aims to give users and developers ways to create digital worlds. Its CEO has also talked about future shopping and conducting business on the platform, which has its own virtual economy powered by its Robux currency.\\n\\nMICROSOFT\\n\\nMicrosoft Corp\\'s CEO Satya Nadella in an earnings call this year said the company was working to build an \"enterprise metaverse\" as the digital and physical worlds converge in its offerings.\\n\\nMicrosoft, which owns Xbox and the world-building game Minecraft, is also a key player in the gaming world. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has talked about planning for \"a metaverse or mixed-reality construct.\"\\n\\nFACEBOOK\\n\\nFacebook, which will start trading as Meta Platforms on Dec 1, has said it wants to be seen as a metaverse company rather than a social media one. The tech giant, which has about 3 billion users, has been investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality and has been building out its VR environment Horizon, accessed through its Quest headsets.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNVIDIA\\n\\nComputer chip maker Nvidia Corp built its Omniverse platform for connecting 3D worlds into a shared virtual universe. It says Omniverse, which is used for projects like creating simulations of real-world buildings and factories, is the \"plumbing\" on which metaverses could be built.\\n\\nUNITY\\n\\nUnity Software Inc, which develops software used to design video games, is another company that could sell tools or technology used to build the metaverse.\\n\\nSNAP\\n\\nSnapchat owner Snap Inc has long been building custom avatars and augmented reality filters to overlay digital features on the real world. This year it unveiled its first true augmented reality glasses, available for developers to experiment with creating experiences for the spectacles.\\n\\nAUTODESK\\n\\nCloud software firm Autodesk makes programs used by architects and engineers to design and create buildings and products. Its software is also used to build virtual worlds for gaming and entertainment.\\n\\nTENCENT\\n\\nChinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd is the world\\'s largest video gaming firm by revenue and has stakes in major game studios like Epic Games and Activision Blizzard. The South China Morning Post reported this year that Tencent has registered many metaverse-related trademarks for its social site QQ.\\n\\nEPIC GAMES\\n\\nEpic is the company behind video game phenomenon Fortnite, which has moved beyond its core shooting game to social experiences like dance parties and virtual music concerts. Users pay to dress their avatars in different costumes and can build their own islands and games. Epic also owns a large gaming engine, Unreal, used to develop games and other visual effects like TV show backdrops.\\n\\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney, a vocal critic of big platforms like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\\'s Google, has argued the metaverse will need to be a participatory, common space.\\n\\nAMAZON\\n\\nEcommerce giant Amazon.com Inc, which is the world\\'s largest cloud services vendor and has multiple media offerings, is also seen as a potential player in the metaverse.\\n\\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford; Editing by Kenneth Li and Cynthia Osterman)',\n",
       " 'I read an interesting interview recently with Clover Health’s (NASDAQ:CLOV) president and chief technology officer, Andrew Toy. The executive spoke about several subjects, including why he chose to join the health care startup in February 2018. But, unfortunately, he didn’t discuss CLOV stock and when it might get out of its funk.  CLOV stock a photo of a stethoscope laying atop medical papers\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nAs Toy points out, Clover is neither a health care plan nor a health care technology provider but a hybrid of the two. While that ultimately will play in the company’s favor, it’s made it difficult for investors to put a price tag on its valuation.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nHere’s why.\\n\\nCLOV Stock Is Stuck in the Middle\\n\\nThe company’s trailing 12-month sales are $280 million. That puts its price-sales ratio at 10.8. That seems pretty good for a relatively new company.\\n\\nHowever, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at 13.9x sales, and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) trades at 44.5x sales. These are two examples of tech stocks getting premium valuations, while the technology Clover utilizes for its Clover Assistant tool gets left out of the equation.\\n\\n7 Retail Stocks to Buy Regardless of Supply Shortages\\n\\n“We can hold the medical risk, focus on collecting a lot of data, and build it into our tool, Clover Assistant, which is used by primary care physicians to give better, personalized data-driven care,” Toy told Healthleaders finance editor Jack O’Brien.\\n\\nIf Clover is given a P/S multiple halfway between MSFT and SHOP at 29.2x sales, it would have a share price of $34.66 [$280 million x 29.2 x 235.9 million shares outstanding], or about 5x its current value.\\n\\nIn the health insurance industry, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which I wrote about in September while discussing Clover, has approximately 1% of UNH’s Medicare Advantage customers. UNH trades at 1.6x sales.\\n\\nDo you see what I’m getting at?\\n\\nThis argument is a double-edged sword. If the markets applied a multiple similar to UNH, CLOV stock would be worth less than $2 [$280 million x 1.6 x 235.9 million shares outstanding], not $7.55, where it currently trades.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSo, it could always be worse.\\n\\nIt Suddenly Dawned on Me\\n\\nAs I was thinking about what to talk about in my latest commentary – there will be plenty to discuss once it reports Q3 2021 earnings on Nov. 8 after the close – I began thinking about the company’s second-largest shareholder, GreenOaks Capital Partners.\\n\\nIt owned 50.1 million shares, or 16.5% of its stock at the end of September. That was down from 74.9 million shares, or 30.6% at the end of July and 96.3 million shares, or 35% at the end of June.\\n\\nSo, in four months, GreenOaks lowered its share count by almost 50%. However, the reductions were in-kind distributions of Class A stock to its investors.\\n\\nThe only other shareholder that comes close is founder and CEO Vivek Garipalli, who owns 83.6 million shares, or 36.8% of the company.\\n\\nGreenOaks led Clover Health’s Series C funding round in May 2016 when the company raised $160 million. It led the subsequent Series D for $130 million and Series E for $500 million.\\n\\n“We are excited to back Vivek, Kris, and the team at Clover as they continue to build on what is already the best value proposition and member experience in Medicare Advantage,” Benny Peretz, partner, GreenOaks Capital, stated in Clover’s 2016 news release announcing the funding.\\n\\n“By combining a data-driven approach to improving health outcomes and a genuine desire to delight its members, Clover offers a Medicare Advantage plan that creates a truly positive impact on member health, while delivering a superior member experience and value that continues to get better and better at a rapid pace.”\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nEven with the significant decline in Clover’s share price – it’s down 28% over the past six months – GreenOaks is likely sitting on a positive return on its investment.\\n\\nI would expect it to hang on to the remainder of its shares until the share price moves back into double digits. However, as a focused investor, GreenOaks doesn’t seem like the kind of hedge fund that gets impatient.\\n\\nFor the long term, if GreenOaks stays in the game, I think that’s a reason for optimism for small retail investors. However, this isn’t the kind of stock you should be investing in for your retirement.\\n\\nCLOV stock still is not a slam-dunk investment.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

       " \"In this article, we discuss the top 8 stock picks of Michael Sidhom’s Immersion Capital. If you want our detailed analysis of Michael Sidhom's history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to the Top 3 Stock Picks of Michael Sidhom's Immersion Capital.\\n\\nMichael Sidhom has been the managing partner at Immersion Capital, a London-based asset management and investment firm, since October 2014. He manages an impressive portfolio of managed 13F securities, valued at $1.03 billion. His portfolio is immensely concentrated on the information technology and communications sectors.\\n\\nThe largest holding in Sidhom’s 13F portfolio is Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) as of the end of the second quarter of 2021, with an approximate stake value of $340.8 million.\\n\\nBefore joining Immersion Capital, Sidhom was the principal and managing director at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private family investment firm in New York City. Sidhom was responsible for their European division, where he managed a multibillion-dollar equities portfolio from 2005 to 2014. Previously, Sidhom was an associate at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), from 2001 to 2005. This was where he started his career in finance, after graduating from the University of Cambridge, with a Bachelor’s degree in 2001.\\n\\nAt the end of June, Sidhom sold out of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) completely, while reducing holdings in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) by 1.03% and 0.02%, respectively.\\n\\nSidhom’s 13F portfolio comprises stocks that are immensely popular among individual investors and hedge funds alike. Some of the most notable stock picks of Michael Sidhom’s Immersion Capital are Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), among others discussed extensively below.\\n\\nWhy should we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment while choosing stocks? Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and July 2021, our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 186.1%, vs. 100.1% for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 86 percentage points (see the details here). That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWith this context in mind, here are some of the top stock picks of Michael Sidhom's Immersion Capital. We used Immersion Capital’s 13F portfolio for the second quarter of 2021 to rank these stocks. The list was compiled according to the value of each holding in the investment portfolio.\\n\\nThe analyst ratings for each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was gauged using the data of 873 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\\n\\nmaxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplash\\n\\nTop Stock Picks of Michael Sidhom's Immersion Capital\\n\\n8. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\\n\\nImmersion Capital’s Stake Value: $3,617,000\\n\\nPercentage of Immersion Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 0.34%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\\n\\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is an American multinational financial services company, headquartered in California.\\n\\nSidhom’s Immersion Capital owns 15,470 shares in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), worth $3.61 million at the end of June.\\n\\nAs of the end of Q2, 162 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported owning stakes in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), down from 164 in Q1.\\n\\nThe company reported earnings on October 26. The EPS was $1.49, up $0.14 as compared to estimates. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)’s revenue was $6.56 billion, exceeding estimates by $45.89 million.\\n\\nOn October 27, JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang kept an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), raising the price target from $267 to $277.\\n\\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of Michael Sidhom’s top stock picks, just like Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).\\n\\nHere is what Polen Capital has to say about Visa Inc. in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Visa Inc. faced pressure as some believe these “old payment infrastructure” businesses will be disrupted by newer fintech companies using blockchain, buy now, pay later (BNPL), or other innovations to provide better/cheaper payment services. However, we believe that some of these technologies have meaningful limitations which could benefit existing payment networks. For example, BNPL transactions are often funded with cards and turn a one-time transaction into many smaller ones with more transaction fees for Visa. Just like with regulation, we continually monitor for competition and technological disruption. As of now, we do not see a significant risk in the foreseeable future to this company.”\\n\\n7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\\n\\nImmersion Capital’s Stake Value: $3,959,000\\n\\nPercentage of Immersion Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 0.38%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 135\\n\\nAnother top stock pick by Michael Sidhom is Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), a mega corporation that has transformed the face of transportation, making it feasible for millions with its mobility-as-a-service business model.\\n\\nImmersion Capital holds stakes valued at $3.95 million in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), representing 0.38% of Sidhom’s Q2 portfolio.\\n\\nAt the end of June, 135 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were bullish on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), up from 130 in the previous quarter.\\n\\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what they said:\\n\\n“The pandemic has also brought attention to the question of gig worker employment status for companies, including ClearBridge holdings Uber and Lyft. In the U.K., Uber proactively classified its drivers as “workers” ahead of final rulings from the British court system. The worker status in the U.K. is a designation between self-employed and employed status that entitles drivers to minimum wage, holiday pay and in some cases a pension.\\n\\nClearBridge has engaged with Uber on labor issues since its IPO, and we have given feedback over that time to the CEO, CFO, Chief Legal Officer and Investor Relations on labor relations as well as strategy and communications. Uber’s agreement on this designation is ahead of other competitors in the market and the legal mandate represents a step forward in the company’s thinking about labor. The agreement represents a short-term hit to earnings, yet in some ways it places Uber ahead of the market in its ability to balance labor and shareholder interests. Workers benefit from improved conditions, with new contributions amounting to roughly 3% of a driver’s earnings, while Uber establishes more certainty on costs and visibility into its regulatory environment and operation conditions in the future.”\\n\\n6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\\n\\nImmersion Capital’s Stake Value: $76,401,000\\n\\nPercentage of Immersion Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 7.36%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\\n\\nServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an American software company specializing in cloud based platforms that help enterprise level firms manage their business operations efficiently.\\n\\nSidhom’s Immersion Capital owns 139,025 shares in ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), amounting to $76.4 million, and making up 7.36% of Sidhom’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 91 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database held stakes amounting to $7.01 billion in ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), up from 98 in the previous quarter with stakes worth over $6.13 billion.\\n\\nThe company reported third quarter’s earnings per share of $1.55 on October 27, beating analysts’ consensus estimates by $0.16. ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW)’s revenue was $1.51 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations by $33.34 million.\\n\\nHere is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“We believe short-term focused investors and consensus often miss the longer-term strength and durability of growth and business-model efficiency (earnings and free cash flow margins) of truly special businesses. An example of this is ServiceNow, a SaaS-industry leader and pioneer, and a long-time Fund investment. As shown in the table below, over the seven years from March 2014 through March 2021, ServiceNow experienced eight multiple declines that averaged –32%, ranging from a low of –19% to a high of –52%.\\n\\nBut during that period, ServiceNow demonstrated compounding revenue performance and stronger operating leverage and FCF generation than expected by consensus. The table below shows the first quarter 2014 projections of one of the top software analysts on the Street, Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley, versus what ServiceNow achieved.\\n\\nAs you can see, over this three-year period, ServiceNow beat revenue expectations by $315 million, or 29%, and generated FCF margins of 23%, trouncing estimates by $186 million, or 138%.The compounding effects of seven years of strong revenue growth and FCF generation drove ServiceNow’s share price to increase from $70.03 on March 5, 2014 to $500.11 on March 31, 2021, a 32% annualized return. A 7-bagger!\\n\\nServiceNow delivered these point-a-to-point-b returns despite the eight multiple pullbacks described above, including the one that occurred towards the end of the first quarter. The power of faster-for-longer, cash-generative business models.”\\n\\n5. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\\n\\nImmersion Capital’s Stake Value: $127,346,000\\n\\nPercentage of Immersion Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 12.27%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 113\\n\\nThe next top stock in Michael Sidhom’s Q2 portfolio is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), an online streaming service and an original programming production company.\\n\\nSidhom’s Immersion Capital owns 241,090 shares in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), amounting to $127.34 million. This accounts for 12.27% of Sidhom’s Q2 portfolio.\\n\\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2021, 113 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with reported stakes of $13.2 billion, down from 110 in the previous quarter with stakes worth $14.1 billion.\\n\\nOn October 19, the company reported earnings for the third quarter. The EPS for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was $3.19, exceeding estimates by $0.63. The revenue exceeded analysts’ estimates by $0.16 million at $7.48 billion.\\n\\nHere is what Ensemble Capital has to say about Netflix, Inc. in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Netflix stock had a disappointing first half of 2021 performance, treading water while the S&P 500 rallied, after a very strong 67% return in 2020. It benefited from the global pandemic in 2020, signing on 36.6 million new subscribers vs the typical 25 million or so it typically does. Total subscribers exceeded 200 million, up 22% over the previous year. However, in the first half of 2021, new subscriber additions slowed substantially, totaling only 5.5 million due to slower new content additions impacted by production delays, a resumption of outdoor activity as people everywhere adjusted to living with COVID, and the impact of a “pull-forward effect” on subscriber growth in last year’s very strong results. The third quarter saw new content velocity start to pick up, which is usually what drives new subscribers to the service, with expectations of an even stronger content slate going into the final quarter of the year, causing the stock to increase 15% in the quarter.”\\n\\n4. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\\n\\nImmersion Capital’s Stake Value: $132,584,000\\n\\nPercentage of Immersion Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 12.77%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 238\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational tech mega corporation, offering computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. The company is best known for Microsoft Windows, the Microsoft Office suite, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge browsers.\\n\\nOut of the 873 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s extensive database, 238 funds were long Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), with stakes worth $62.46 billion at the end of June, down from 251 in the previous quarter, with a total stake value of $58.9 billion.\\n\\nHere is what Alger has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Microsoft Corporation was among the top contributors to performance during the third quarter. Microsoft is a Positive Dynamic Change beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s enterprise cloud product, Azure, is rapidly growing and accruing market share. Microsoft reported that Azure grew 51% in the second quarter. This high unit volume growth is a primary driver of the company’s higher share price, but the company’s strong operating execution has enabled margin expansion that has also helped to increase forward earnings estimates. We believe Microsoft’s subscription-based software offerings and cloud computing services have a durable growth profile because they enhance customers’ growth initiatives and help them to diminish costs. Additionally, investors appreciate Microsoft’s strong free cash flow generation and its return of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 3 Stock Picks of Michael Sidhom's Immersion Capital.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Peter Lewis' LFL Advisers 7 Best Stocks and SPACs to Buy Based on Jonathan Esfandi's JNE Partners' Latest Portfolio 10 Monthly Dividend Covered Call ETFs and ETNs You Can Count On\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

       " 'First launch in UK\\n\\nCAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, Nov. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bango (AIM: BGO), the global platform for data-driven commerce, is powering the first Telco to offer bundled Microsoft 365 subscriptions, launching with a major global telecoms provider in the UK. Used by more than a half billion people, Microsoft 365 combines the full Office suite of Microsoft Office 365 apps with Microsoft Teams collaboration software.\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is leveraging the Bango Platform to enable resellers including Telcos, banks, retailers and insurance providers to bundle Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family subscriptions as part of their customer offers. The consumer appeal of bundled media subscriptions has seen the marketing model become widely adopted, providing resellers with a powerful way to differentiate themselves. The addition of the world’s leading productivity apps to the mix of services available to bundle is an exciting opportunity for resellers, giving customers more of what they want.\\n\\n“Bango and Microsoft are increasing choice for consumers. Microsoft 365 subscriptions are a compelling value add, complementing the movie, music and gaming media subscriptions offered by resellers as part of their bundled packages,” said Jim Plimmer, SVP Payment Product Strategy & Sales at Bango. “With theBango Platform, resellers have the most flexible solution to provide a limitless variety of bundled offers. Once live, data insights from the Bango Platform optimize targeting to get the right offer, to the right people at the right time.”\\n\\nThis launch expands the partnership between Bango and Microsoft which sees Bango powering Telco bundles for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions.\\n\\nAbout Bango\\n\\nThe world’s largest online merchants, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, use Bango technology to acquire more paying users.\\n\\nBango has developed unique purchase behavior technology that enables millions more users to buy the products and services they want, using innovative methods of payment including carrier billing, digital wallets and subscription bundling. Bango harnesses this purchase activity into valuable marketing segments, called Bango Audiences.

       " 'Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the premier tech giants on the market. The company has solid fundamentals and some special features that make investors happy, such as buybacks and dividend increases. With gains of about 50% year-to-date (YTD), MSFT stock has also outperformed the broader U.S. stock market. Now all eyes are on the fiscal 2022 first-quarter earnings report, which the company released on Oct. 26. microsoft stock\\n\\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nDoes MSFT stock have more upside potential this year? The earnings report is crucial to the company maintaining its strong momentum. Mainly, the two factors that now concern me about Microsoft are the premium reflected in its stock price and the potential slowdown in its revenue growth.\\n\\nHere’s what you should know about MSFT stock moving forward.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nMSFT Stock: Consistency and a Strong Balance Sheet\\n\\nMicrosoft is a textbook top-quality stock. It’s highly profitable and has increased revenue and shareholder equity as well as reduced debt. At the same time, it has also implemented a share buyback program and consistently increased its dividend. In fact, that consistency is something I appreciate the most about MSFT stock.\\n\\nThe growth numbers speak for themselves here. Data taken from Morningstar shows solid 3-year average growth for revenue (15.06%), operating income (25.87%), net income (54.63%) and diluted earnings per share (EPS) (55.77%). The strong balance sheet is another positive factor. Microsoft has reduced its debt-equity (D/E) ratio to o.42.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nOn top of all this, one of my favorite financial metrics — free cash flow (FCF) — is also demonstrating strength for this name. The free cash flow has consistently increased for years now. For fiscal 2021, Microsoft reported FCF of $56.12 billion, an increase of 24% year-over-year (YOY). This FCF was particularly exceptional, as the company reported a high gross margin (68.9%), operating margin (41.6%) and net margin (36.4%) for the period as well.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAll told, Microsoft was firing on all cylinders last year — and it seems to be continuing that strength.\\n\\nDividend Increases and Share Repurchases\\n\\nLike I noted before, another reason to like MSFT stock are its dividend increases and share repurchases. The company’s consistency in this department is noteworthy. What’s more, on Sept. 14, Microsoft announced some very positive news for shareholders.\\n\\nThe news? A quarterly dividend of 62 cents — an 11% increase over the previous quarter — as well as a “new share repurchase program authorizing up to $60 billion in share repurchases.”\\n\\nFor some time, the number of shares outstanding here has been declining while the yearly dividend has been climbing. In particular, Microsoft seems to be keeping up with an average 10% annual increase for its dividend. Notably, though, its current payout of around 27% is both sustainable and also the lowest ratio reported in recent years.\\n\\nSo, Microsoft has rewarded investors with a consistent dividend policy and consistent share buybacks. That’s a big plus for investors. But the company could easily increase its dividend rate from here, given the current payout ratio. My best guess? Management will soon weigh the tradeoff between future growth and returning capital to its shareholders.\\n\\nWhat to Make of Recent Earnings\\n\\nDividends and the like aside, though, I have had a different main concern with MSFT stock. My worry? The potential slowdown in revenue and earnings. However, the recent earnings report has revealed some positives.\\n\\nWhen Microsoft released Q1 fiscal 2022 earnings in late October, it showed a “strong start” to the year. Specifically, Executive Vice President and CFO Amy Hood noted that Microsoft Cloud generated “$20.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% year over year.” Furthermore, revenue for the period came to $45.3 billion, an increase of 22%. Meanwhile, operating income was $20.2 billion — up 27% — and non-GAAP net income was $17.2 billion. The latter was an increase of 24%. Finally, diluted non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $2.27, up 25%.\\n\\nThese financial results show that a growth slowdown doesn’t seem to be in the cards — at least not yet. But if we do see any misses in the coming quarters? Well, investors may want to take future results with a grain of salt.\\n\\nIn a word, it all comes down to seasonality. In the company’s annual 10-K report for fiscal 2021, Microsoft stated the following (Page 40):\\n\\n“Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.”\\n\\nSo, while investors may be inclined to worry about misses in the future, they may not have to as much — especially for the first and third quarters.\\n\\nA Diversified Business and Pricey Stock\\n\\nThe last thing I will note about Microsoft, however, is the company’s relevance in recent years — and its diversity.\\n\\nFor one, Microsoft has embraced the digital work environment whole-heartedly. It has several diversified streams of revenue — from the Xbox to LinkedIn to cloud computing, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI). Moreover, it has also made changes to its investor metrics, heightening transparency and helping investors evaluate the company’s progress accurately. But does all of this mean you should invest in MSFT stock?\\n\\nThe pluses about the company aside, MSFT is still a tough name to consider buying right now. Of course, relative valuation is just one method of analysis. However, data from CSI Market is mixed on whether Microsoft is undervalued or not. For example, the price-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently 37.26, compared to the Industry P/E of 35 and Sector P/E of 27.\\n\\nThat said, Microsoft also has a PEG ratio of 0.84. This suggests it is undervalued. Still, checking the trailing price-sales (P/S) ratio of 14, the company’s P/S is higher than the sector median as well. The same goes for the company’s price-book (P/B) ratio and price-cash flow ratio.\\n\\nOverall, these metrics suggest that MSFT stock is now trading at a premium.\\n\\nThe Verdict on MSFT Stock\\n\\nAll told, MSFT stock is an excellent name that trades at an extremely high cost.\\n\\nThis company boasts solid fundamentals and robust growth. It also returns capital to shareholders. Still, it’s incredibly pricey as well. Any selloff would make for a better risk-adjusted investment opportunity here — unless Microsoft hikes its dividend rate even faster or expands its share repurchase program.\\n\\nAt some point, a slowdown in revenue and EPS may come into play. This factor will be crucial for potential investors. However, that may take a long time to arrive as well.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Georgiadis did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Historically, mid-cap and small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks. According to a report published by Baird, a financial services company, mid-cap stocks have outperformed the large-caps 75% of the time since 1999.\\n\\nHowever, risks associated with small-cap stocks should be taken into account before investing. Large-cap stocks have outperformed small-caps during times of economic expansion. During the dot-com boom in the 1980s, S&P 500 topped Russell 2000 by 91% from 1983 to 1990. Similarly, in the first three months of 2020, the S&P 500 benchmark of large-cap stocks outperformed Russell 2000 by 20%, as reported by the foreign exchange company, CME Group.\\n\\nIn this regard, some of the notable stocks are Facebook, Inc.

Overall, 58 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in the company in Q2, valued at $2.7 billion. The hedge fund sentiment was positive for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in Q2, as 52 hedge funds had stakes in the company in the previous quarter.\\n\\nIn Q2 2021, the gross bookings at Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stood at $13 billion, versus the estimates of $11.19 billion. The stock is up 21.58% in 2021.\\n\\nLike Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the most notable large-cap stocks to buy.\\n\\nWorm Capital LLC mentioned Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Throughout the quarter, you may have noticed that we averaged into a significant position in Airbnb (ABNB). Though the stock has been a relative underperformer since its February highs, we are highly confident about the company’s prospects and its ability to generate meaningful compounded returns over time.\\n\\nSome history: We have been following Airbnb’s journey for several years, long before the company went public earlier this year. (In fact, nine years ago, in November 2012, Eric profiled the company for Inc.: “Airbnb Is Changing Travel.”)\\n\\nWhenever we underwrite a new investment, we look for a few key attributes that help us determine the potential long-term value of a business, as well as its risks. In particular, we focus on management (Are they founders? Do they have skin the game? Are they playing the long game?), addressable market size (How big is the opportunity?), its relative growth and creativity to expand (Are they constantly innovating to make the product better for their customers?), margin expansion (Where can we find operating leverage in the model?), its status in the industry (Are they the dominant player? Can they take market share from incumbents?), business risks (What are we missing? Are customers dissatisfied? What do employees say?) and probably a dozen more elements that are critical to our process. It’s only then do we take out the pencils do the valuation work.\\n\\nIn short, ABNB fulfills pretty much every element of a business model we’re attracted to: First, it’s highly scalable marketplace-based business model that unites buyer and seller with observable flywheel effects. (This is an important observation, in that the platform creates significant economic value for millions of hosts who rely on Airbnb, which in turn attracts new hosts who identify the opportunity, which creates more inventory, which turn attracts more travelers, which attracts more hosts, and soon.) Second, it has a global focus with significant opportunities to expand its operating leverage; Third, its management—which is still founder-led—stands out to us as long-term thinkers capable of handling crisis, which the team demonstrated throughout the pandemic by dropping operating costs and turning the business into a more efficient, lean organization. (Like Churchill said: “Never let a good crisis go to waste.”)..”\\n\\n9. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\\n\\nLowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), an American home improvement retail company, reported solid earnings in Q2 2021, with a GAAP EPS of $4.25, beating the estimates by $0.30. The company stands ninth on our list of the best large-cap stocks to buy.\\n\\nPershing Square is the largest shareholder of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), with shares worth roughly $2 billion. At the end of June, 63 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in the company, up from 61 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes is over $4.9 billion.\\n\\nRecently, UBS lifted its price target on Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) to $250, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares. The firm’s analyst expects the company to generate healthy EPS growth in the next year as it repurchased stocks worth $9 billion in Q2.\\n\\nPershing Square Holdings Ltd. mentioned Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lowe’s has experienced a signifi cant acceleration in demand driven by consumers nesting at home, higher home asset utilization and the reallocation of discretionary spend. In the three years since Marvin Ellison became CEO, the company has executed a multi-year transformation plan to bolster Lowe’s retail fundamentals, reduce structural costs, expand distribution capabilities, and modernize systems and the company’s online capabilities. This transformation has allowed Lowe’s to meet consumers’ needs during this highly elevated period of demand, and positioned the company for continued success and accelerated earnings growth.\\n\\nIn the second quarter, Lowe’s reported U.S. same-store-sales growth of 2.2%. Growth was bolstered by strength from the critical Pro consumer, where Lowe’s reported growth of 21%, off setting moderating do-it-yourself (“DIY”) demand. While DIY demand has receded from peak-COVID-19 periods, Pro customer demand has accelerated as consumers engage Pro’s for larger renovation projects.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the headline growth fi gure, which is impacted by comparisons to COVID-19-aff ected months from spring of 2020, demand remains extremely elevated relative to baseline 2019 levels. July same-store-sales, the most recent full month for which the company has provided disclosure, were up 31.5% on a two-year basis and management indicated August month-to-date results are substantially similar. More signifi cantly, Lowe’s reported Pro growth of +49% on a two-year basis in Q2, evidence that Lowe’s focus on the Pro is bearing fruit. Share gains with the critical Pro customer will provide a tailwind to growth that should allow Lowe’s to outperform market-level growth going forward.\\n\\nEven as the robust demand experienced during the height of COVID-19 stabilizes at a new base, the medium and longer-term macro environment remain very attractive for the home improvement sector and Lowe’s in particular. This favorable context for the sector is evidenced by consumers’ enhanced focus and appreciation of the importance of the home, higher home asset utilization, rising home prices, historically low mortgage rates, an aging housing stock, strong consumer balance sheets, and the general lack of new housing inventory.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, Lowe’s is focused on taking market share and expanding margins. Pro penetration today is still only 25% of revenue as compared to Lowe’s medium-term target of 30% to 35%, providing a runway for continued abovemarket growth. Management continues to execute against various operational initiatives (Lowe’s “Perpetual Productivity Improvement” program) designed to improve the customer experience while enhancing the company’s margins and longterm earnings power. The company’s long-term outlook implies signifi cant opportunity for continued margin expansion and earnings appreciation as it executes its business transformation.\\n\\nLowe’s currently trades at approximately 17 times forward earnings. Home Depot, its closest competitor, trades at approximately 22 times forward earnings despite Lowe’s superior prospective earnings growth. We find this valuation disparity to be anomalous in light of Lowe’s strong execution and potential for further operational optimization.”\\n\\n8. Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\\n\\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) reported an 89% growth in average revenue per user (ARPU) in Q2, compared with the prior-year quarter.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Pinterest is an operator of a pinboard-style social media website that enables users to create theme-based image collections for events, hobbies, and other personal interests. The firm delivered another quarter of both earnings and forward guidance above investor expectations, sending shares higher. Strength was driven by notable user growth and a return of advertising spending. We remain excited about an increase in video content, new analytics tools for advertisers, and an increasing shift towards ecommerce.”\\n\\n7. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\\n\\nIn September, Goldman Sachs appreciated the impressive growth of Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) over the years. The investment bank lauded the company’s dominant position in augmented reality (AR) and expects its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 48% through 2023. The firm lifted its price target on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) to $90, with a Buy rating on the shares.\\n\\nIn Q2 2021, the company reported the highest revenue in four years at $982 million, up 116% from the same period last year and beating the analysts’ expectations by 16%.\\n\\nOf the 873 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 64 hedge funds were bullish on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in Q2, with stakes valued at $5.3 billion.\\n\\nRiverPark Funds mentioned Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its recently published Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Snap shares were a top contributor for the quarter as well, also driven by strong first quarter results. The company reported accelerating revenue growth of 66% for the period (up from 62% fourth quarter growth), driven by user growth of 22%, and a 36% expansion in average revenue per user (ARPU). The company also guided to stronger-than-expected and accelerating 81%-85% revenue growth for second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $79 million year over year for a break-even margin, up 1,800 basis points, and free cash flow improved dramatically, turning positive for the period to $126 million. Snap also continued to roll-out products that should help drive further expansion in user growth and ARPU, including Spotlight, a TikTok-like experience, with more than 125 million Snapchatters using it during March, and original programming starring Ryan Reynolds.\\n\\nWith TTM of $2.8 billion in revenue and an ARPU that is about 1/2 that of Twitter and 1/3 that of Facebook, we believe Snap has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, grows its audience, and continues to advance its monetization.”\\n\\n6.

       " 'No matter how you slice it, the so-called ‘transitory’ inflation that made headline after headline earlier this year, looks more permanent.\\n\\nIn September, headline inflation increased at an annual rate of 4.4%. As reported by outlets, that was the fastest rate of increase since 1991.\\n\\nThe Fed refers to core inflation as its primary measurement of price changes of goods and services. But that too increased substantially — 3.6% in September. There was no change from August, but it was still the fastest rate of change in 30 years. Further, it warrants understanding what core inflation ignores: the costs of food and energy.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe other worrisome fact is that personal income declined 1% in September. And as transitory inflation proves more permanent, that leads to the specter of hyperinflation. Well, hyperinflation is typically defined as a 50% rise per month. So, despite ominous warnings from Jack Dorsey, hyperinflation is hyperbole and will remain so.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nThat said, it makes sense to adjust your portfolio to accommodate inflation. Here are stocks that should help:\\n\\nAltria (NYSE:MO) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN) Newmont (NYSE:NEM) ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:BITO) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\\n\\nHyperinflation Stocks: Altria (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\\n\\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nYou might not like Altria for the fact that it is a tobacco company that produces cigarettes. If that’s the case, you certainly would find many in agreement with you regarding the evils of big tobacco and smoking in general.\\n\\nThat said, as a stock pick, Altria makes a lot of sense as inflation woes increase. On the one hand, there are reports that cigarette sales are increasing for the first time in 20 years. That may not sound like much, but again, it’s a sea change.\\n\\nFurther, as inflation rises, consumers have greater levels of anxiety. As a result, so-called sin stocks like Altria get a boost.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThis means Altria could reasonably expect increasing revenues in these troubling times. That’s a positive for shareholders. The other positive is that Altria pays a massive dividend yielding 8.15%. It does so to balance the decline in profitability as tobacco use declines. Well, a decline in tobacco use is reversing — at least temporarily. That means investors will see rising revenues and benefit from that nearly 90 cent quarterly dividend.\\n\\nThat dividend alone should outstrip inflation. Add it all up and Altria makes sense for all investors but the most steadfast anti-smoking advocates.\\n\\nCoca-Cola (KO) a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cans\\n\\nSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nCoca-Cola often makes its way onto lists of stocks to benefit in times of inflation. The general thesis is that consumer goods bear the brunt of inflation. Consumers continue to purchase, especially staple goods (Coca-Cola isn’t a staple), and revenues rise as a consequence.\\n\\nWhile Coca-Cola is a consumer packaged goods firm, the other benefit is its rock-steady nature as an investment. It probably isn’t hyperbolic to say that it’s a part of American culture. That means it’s pretty much everywhere at all times and that people buy it consistently.\\n\\nThat translates to prices that don’t waver. KO stock carries a beta of 0.64. In other words, when the market drops by $1, KO stock drops by 64 cents. The opposite is true: When things are going well in the market KO stock doesn’t appreciate as quickly. But that’s the allure of Coca-Cola’s defensive nature.\\n\\n7 Retail Stocks to Buy Regardless of Supply Shortages\\n\\nCoca-Cola’s massive scale and dominant position allow it to adjust its business mix in slight ways that keep it steady. Investors can pretty much purchase KO shares and forget them. There’s little chance that things go wrong for long. Analysts expect that the firm will record approximately $38 billion in revenue in 2021. That’ll grow to $40 billion in 2022. The company will adjust slightly on an annual basis, and you can expect those figures to grow. That’s what it does, and that’s why Coca-Cola is steady over the long term.\\n\\nHyperinflation Stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\\n\\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThere’s nothing surprising or unexpected about JNJ popping up on this list. Any investors who seek information regarding steady, defensive equities are bound to come across Johnson & Johnson sooner or later.\\n\\nAnd with good reason. JNJ stock has a beta of 0.72, so it has a track record of weathering storms. Even at the onset of the pandemic Johnson & Johnson shares only dropped to $120 from $150. Their recovery was relatively quick and the steadfastness returned.\\n\\nJNJ stock bears a dividend yielding 2.6%. History shows that Johnson & Johnson pays four straight quarterly dividends of the same price and then bumps that dividend up 5 or 6 cents. That trend holds true back to 2012. That suggests shareholders could reasonably expect a dividend increase in Q2 of next year. And the firm hasn’t decreased a dividend since 1981.\\n\\nInvestors won’t get rich quick by investing in JNJ shares. But at the same time, they won’t find themselves losing money either. Analyst consensus suggests an average target price of $185.24 for JNJ stock. That’s positive considering current price levels at $163.70. Expect a slow march toward that target in any case. That and steady income from the firm’s dividend.\\n\\nLennar Corp. (LEN) Residential neighborhood subdivision skyline Aerial shot\\n\\nSource: TDKvisuals / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nFor investors looking to hedge against inflation, one of the smartest ways is to invest in stocks related to assets that are inflating in price. That’s why when food costs rise, analysts always suggest considering CPG stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).\\n\\nHousing is certainly an asset as well. It’s no secret that housing costs are rising, and that trend doesn’t look to be slowing next year. Therefore, just as it makes sense to buy PG stock when food prices rise it also makes sense to buy housing stocks when housing prices rise.\\n\\nLennar is one of the biggest home builders in the U.S., and its geographic footprint coincides with areas of high growth. The company operates and builds homes along the coasts, in the southeast and in Texas, among others.\\n\\nThat gives it plenty of upside, and may logically explain its $120 average target price while it currently trades at around $100, opening on Nov. 2 at $101.29. LEN stock pays a modest dividend of 25 cents on a quarterly basis. That will help to curb any volatility. But it should also be noted that Lennar isn’t as steady as other equities on this list. Its beta of 1.52 doesn’t suggest it can’t move quickly.\\n\\n7 Top Stocks to Buy On Any Dip If You Get the Chance in Q4\\n\\nThe bullish thesis here is that Lennar plays into rising housing costs, but isn’t necessarily an overall “safe” play.\\n\\nHyperinflation Stocks: Newmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont (NEM) logo on a mobile phone screen\\n\\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\\n\\nWhen the value of the dollar decreases, one of the oldest notions is to turn to the other store of value: gold. That’s why Newmont is on this list. Newmont is the largest gold mining company in the world.\\n\\nIn 2020 Newmont produced 5.88 million ounces of gold, making it the No. 1 gold mining company by volume. Newmont released earnings on Oct. 28. It reported 1.45 million ounces of gold production in the quarter. That would equate to 5.8 million ounces of annual production on a per capita basis. That would be less than last year’s total. However, the company expects that it will exceed 2020’s 5.88 million ounces of gold production. In the latest earnings report Newmont increased guidance for 2021, expecting to reach 6.0 million ounces.\\n\\nCEO Tom Palmer wants investors to recognize his firm’s strategic shift, which is underpinned by dividends:\\n\\n“Supported by our clear strategic focus and proven operating model, we continue to apply our disciplined approach to capital allocation. A year ago, we announced our industry-leading dividend framework, establishing a clear pathway for stable and predictable returns. Over the last four quarters, Newmont has steadily reinvested in our operations while returning more than $2 billion dollars to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.”\\n\\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) A Bitcoin (BTC) coin surrounded by gold.\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (exchange-traded fund) has made a lot of headlines lately. And BITO shares are certainly worthy of the attention they’re receiving.\\n\\nFor one, the Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) linked fund is the fastest ETF to reach $1 billion of assets under management. To some this is hardly surprising. Proponents of cryptocurrency have long awaited the approval of Bitcoin-backed investment products for several years.\\n\\nYet, to others, the news is still surprising. The Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected prior applications to get a Bitcoin ETF publicly traded. This ETF is also interesting in that it is backed by Bitcoin futures rather than actual ownership of Bitcoin itself. That means investors in BITO are subject to the fluctuations in price of Bitcoin, and thus risk.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Energy Stocks to Buy Before Winter Strikes\\n\\nThe reason that BITO finds its way onto this list about hyperinflation concerns is that cryptocurrency acts as a counter to fiat currency — in this case, the U.S. dollar. BITO is an ETF, therefore not technically a stock. However, ETFs trade and act similarly to stocks.\\n\\nHyperinflation Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.\\n\\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMicrosoft isn’t known as a defensive stock. And it is likely on very few inflation stock lists. Further, it’s a tech giant and recently made headlines as it overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the largest company by market capitalization. At present, it’s still in the lead by about $22 billion.\\n\\nThat move was precipitated by Microsoft’s strong quarter combined with supply chain issues at Apple.\\n\\nIn any case, Microsoft isn’t going anywhere despite inflation concerns or much else. MSFT stock has proven rock steady over the past several years. It has hardly missed a beat while running upward from $100 in 2019 to over $300 currently. In fact, MSFT carries a beta of 0.8.\\n\\nThe company is also quietly continuing to increase its dividend. There are signs that it looks to become more mature and given its No. 2 spot in cloud computing there’s steady growth on the horizon as well.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       " 'Fidelity National Information Services FIS is scheduled to release third-quarter 2021 earnings on Nov 4, before the bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to reflect year-over-year growth.\\n\\nIn the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notable increases in margin and organic revenue growth were positives. However, rising expenses posed a major concern.\\n\\nNotably, Fidelity delivered earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, while meeting in the other, the average beat being 2.93%.\\n\\nFidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nFidelity National Information Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Quote\\n\\nPrior to the third-quarter earnings release, the company is witnessing downward estimate revision, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter earnings has been revised marginally downward to $1.68 over the past month. Nonetheless, the figure suggests year-over-year growth of 18.31%.\\n\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $3.52 billion indicates a year-over-year jump of 10.15%. Fidelity expects GAAP revenues for the to-be reported quarter to be between $3.49 billion and $3.52 billion, with organic revenue growth of 9-10%.\\n\\nFactors at Play\\n\\nFidelity is well positioned to benefit from the digital transformation of the global economy as well as the increasing investments in mobile banking and innovative products, and in financial infrastructure. The company’s several payment solution platforms, including Modern Banking Platform, RealNet and Payments One, have been winning new clients, and are likely to have supported its Banking Solutions unit. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from this unit is $1.62 billion, suggesting a 7% rise from the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nAlthough the Delta variant is expected to have impacted travel trends during the third quarter, cross-border travel is likely to have rebounded comparatively, following the relaxation of the pandemic-induced restrictions in several countries. Demand for the company’s e-commerce payment gateway and new payments platform is anticipated to have shot up. This, along with several other products and services that Fidelity offers to merchants internationally, is expected to have boosted revenue growth. The consensus mark for Merchant Solutions unit’s revenues is $1.19 billion, suggesting a jump of 16.6% year over year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nEarlier in October, Microsoft fortified its global payments relationship with Worldpay (acquired by Fidelity in July 2019). Worldpay will offer online credit and debit card processing for Microsoft online store fronts, including, Xbox, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft brands in the Asia Pacific, Americas and Europe.\\n\\nIn July, Worldpay also partnered with cryptocurrency platform, OKCoin, to provide global merchant acquiring and foreign-exchange services to support the latter’s continued global expansion. In May, Fidelity partnered with NYDIG to enable banks to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold bitcoin via the FIS’ Digital One Mobile application, enabling a user-friendly interface connecting consumers seamlessly in app with bitcoin trading. Given the growing demand in the payments market for convenient payment options, such tie-ups are expected to provide a significant growth opportunity over the long term. Also, revenue synergies from the Worldpay deal continue to aid financials.\\n\\nHowever, the company’s focus on rolling out innovative products in order to meet customers’ rising demand might have inflated expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of high contribution margins in the business, management expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin to expand 190-220 basis points to 44-45%. The adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $1.55-$1.58 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 14-16%.\\n\\nWhat the Zacks Model Predicts\\n\\nOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Fidelity this time around.

Microsoft last week said revenue from Azure, its flagship cloud offering, grew 48%, results that helped it overtake Apple Inc as the world\\'s most valuable publicly traded company.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s strategy has involved constructing its most lucrative cloud software services, such as database tools, so that they can run inside its own data centers, those owned by customers or even those of rivals like Amazon.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s cloud and artificial intelligence chief Scott Guthrie told Reuters that the move has persuaded some customers to use its services when they cannot always use Microsoft\\'s data centers. Royal Bank of Canada, Guthrie said, faces legal requirements to keep some of its computing work in its own data centers and uses a technology called Azure Arc to connect those facilities to Microsoft\\'s cloud.\\n\\n\"The challenge with higher-level services historically has been the concern of \\'lock in\\' - what happens if I can only use them in your data center?\" Guthrie said. \"That freedom of movement causes customers to feel much more comfortable using those services.\"\\n\\nEd Anderson, a vice president distinguished analyst with Gartner, said the approach does open doors for Microsoft with customers, but it also forces the company to compete on the quality of its software services rather than by packaging them with cheap computing power.\\n\\n\"To be honest, that\\'s a better way to compete,\" Anderson said. \"Customers are suspicious of rhetoric.

Microsoft wants to sell more cloud software that lets customers ranging from retailers to manufacturers do this.\\n\\n“You could, for instance, experience a Best Buy store in the metaverse” and check out displays and devices, Spataro said. “Today when you think of a website, it is not very well connected to the physicality of what we experience.”\\n\\nTo that end, Microsoft also unveiled a product called Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces on Tuesday. It will let people move and interact within retail and factory spaces.\\n\\nWhile Microsoft is leading with corporate applications for the metaverse, expect its Xbox gaming platform to take part in the future, Nadella said.\\n\\n“You can absolutely expect us to do things in gaming,” he said “If you take Halo as a game, it is a metaverse. Minecraft is a metaverse, and so is Flight Sim. In some sense, they are 2D today, but the question is, can you now take that to a full 3D world, and so we absolutely plan to do so.”\\n\\nMicrosoft’s metaverse apps will work with the Oculus googles made by Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook. But it’s not yet clear how various companies’ visions of the metaverse will be able to connect. If, say, Nadella and Zuckerberg wanted to meet up in the metaverse, would they have to choose either Microsoft’s Teams or Meta’s Horizon Workroom?\\n\\nMicrosoft is focused on practical applications of the metaverse — ones where the benefits are clear, Nadella said. And that will help get people get accustomed to an idea that some critics call creepy.\\n\\n“There is nothing creepy about visiting a Covid ward remotely for a doctor to be able to help their patients, or to be able to do remote assistance in a manufacturing line in a time of Covid crisis when that manufacturing line needs to be fixed by an engineer working from home,” he said.\\n\\nAt the Ignite conference, Microsoft also announced:\\n\\nAzure OpenAI, a cloud-based service that lets customers — by invitation only for now — use the system’s powerful artificial intelligence models New Teams features for working and chatting with users and groups outside a particular corporate network Loop, a new application that operates across different programs to collect files, links and data from other apps into a single workspace.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe Slip-and-Fall King Wants to Save You From Your Next Wipeout Big Teacher Is Watching: How AI Spyware Took Over Schools Australia Braces for Life After Covid Zero The Amazon Is Fast Approaching a Point of No Return Workers Press for Power in Rare Advance for U.S. Labor Movement\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",
       " \"PTC Inc PTC is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Nov 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $427.5 million, which suggests growth of 9.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is at 66 cents, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 15.4%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 40.9%, on average.\\r\\n\\r\\nPTC reported third-quarter fiscal 2021 non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share, up 34% on a year-over-year basis. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29.7%. Revenues came in at $436 million, up 24% year over year (up 19% at constant currency or cc) driven by strength across Core and Growth product groups as well as contributions from Arena.

Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nPTC Inc. price-eps-surprise | PTC Inc.

The transition to a subscription business model from a perpetual license model is expected to have boosted recurring revenue growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nContribution from Arena Solutions is expected to have positively impacted top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Arena Solutions’ takeover has been helping PTC in providing its customers (especially in the medical devices and high-tech manufacturing verticals) with a comprehensive software as a service (SaaS) solution, which encompasses computer-aided design (CAD) and PLM offerings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe favorable mix of new logo activity and healthy uptake of Onshape’s school-from-home CAD solution in the education vertical due to the continuation in online learning is likely to have benefitted PTC’s Onshape business.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupply chain disruptions, increasing operating expenses and exposure to verticals like commercial airlines, yet to recover entirely from the pandemic aftermath, are likely to have affected PTC’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for PTC this time around.

Despite the market shock, large-cap stocks provided investors with consistent growth. For instance, the biggest ETFs that track the US large-cap market outperformed amid the pandemic-led recession in which the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) gained 39.2% over the last year, while the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) gained 40.4%.\\n\\nSome of the top-performing stocks included in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) holdings are Apple Inc.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\\n\\nWe start the list of 10 best stocks to buy today with oil giant Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The California-based energy company is a popular long-term stock among investors not only because it has petroleum operations all over the world, but also because it is a consistent dividend-paying stock that increased its payout for more than three decades. The company currently pays an annual dividend of $5.36 per share and offers a dividend yield of 4.89%.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway, led by legendary investor and billionaire Warren Buffett, is the largest shareholder in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) as of Q2, with 23.1 million shares valued at $2.42 billion. At the end of June 2021, 50 of the 873 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares in the oil behemoth.\\n\\nOn October 7, Truist analyst Neal Dingmann kept a Buy rating on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and raised his price target for the stock to $150 from $145. The stock gained 30%, year to date.\\n\\n9. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\\n\\nIn 2020, investors poured in approximately $500 billion in the renewable energy sector alongside electric vehicles, and American utility giant NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the clean energy companies that benefited from it. Billionaire and investor David Shaw of D E Shaw increased his stake in the Florida-based renewable energy company by 92%.\\n\\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), which ranks ninth on the list of 10 best stocks to buy today, is a major player in the growing renewable energy sector serving over 5.6 million customers in North America. The company operates nearly 40 major solar power plants in the US through its FPL segment. Additionally, the company is one of the leading generators of sun and wind energies in North America. In 2020, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) operated 3,148 megawatts of universal-scale solar energy and 16,000 MW of wind energy in the U.S.\\n\\nAnother factor that attracts investors to NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is the company's streak of 26 consecutive annual dividend increases.\\n\\n8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\\n\\nEven though Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw a decline in the number of hedge funds having stakes in the company in the second quarter, the electric vehicle maker remains one of the most popular automotive stocks among institutional investors. At the end of June, 60 funds out of the 873 tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company, compared to 62 in the previous quarter.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) held 21% of the market share for global electric vehicles sales. The California-based EV behemoth delivered 241,300 vehicles in the third quarter, far exceeding analysts' expectations of 220,900. Shares of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared more than 19%, year to date.\\n\\nOn October 15, the EV stock jumped 3% after Jefferies raised its price target for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to $950 from $850 with a Buy rating. Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois believes that the soon-to-be-launched Berlin Gigafactory would provide a higher EV manufacturing and delivery capacity for Telsa, Inc.\\n\\nThe American EV manufacturer, which ranks eighth on the list of 10 best stocks to buy today, continues to dominate China's passenger car market. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) captured a roughly 15% market share in EV sales in September, with 357,000 EVs sold in China. For the first three quarters of 2021, Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y and Model 3 are among the 15 best-selling electric vehicles in China, trailing only General Motors' Hongguang Mini.\\n\\nIn the Q3 2021 investor letter of Worm Capital LLC, the management firm mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and discussed its stance on the firm. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Our core portfolio as of this writing—TSLA, SPOT, SHOP, ABNB, and AMZN—are all premier examples of companies that use the concept of aggregation of marginal gains to continuously improve their value proposition for customers. After all, what is innovation if not just a continuous search for fractional advantages in business?\\n\\nThe way we see it, Tesla is perhaps the generational example of the marginal gain aggregation theory. It’s also been our largest position for several years now. There are many ways to characterize and value this business (see previous letters for long-form write-ups), but perhaps the best way to think about the company is that it is a highly vertically integrated software and hardware firm that’s devoted entirely to aggregating marginal gains across its organization. The goal? Lower costs, improve thruputs and dramatically enhance the value proposition—at scale—for consumers…” (Click here to see the full text)\\n\\n7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\\n\\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has turned to e-commerce and grown to be one of the biggest players in the online shopping space as a result of the huge number of buyers who shifted to online shopping during the pandemic. In the second quarter of 2021, the supermarket giant's e-commerce sales in the United States increased by 6% year over year, while the company's global e-commerce sales are on pace to finish $75 billion by the end of the year. The company's total revenue in the second quarter grew by 2.4% from a year earlier to $141.05 billion.\\n\\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), which ranks seventh on the list of 10 best stocks to buy today, continues to expand its retail and e-commerce market share and as a result, more investors are watching the retailer stock. Multi-billionaire and investor Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the Arkansas-based retail giant as of the second quarter, with a $1.78 billion stake. On October 18, Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane upgraded Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to Conviction Buy from Buy and raised her price target for the stock to $196 from $184.\\n\\nOverall, 71 funds of the 873 elite funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of June 2021, up from 58 in the preceding quarter.\\n\\nJust like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best stocks to buy today for long-term investment, according to market analysts.\\n\\n6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\\n\\nRanking sixth on the list of 10 best stocks to buy today is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the top tech companies profiting from the growing gaming market globally, which is anticipated to reach $314 billion by 2026. Shares of the chipmaker have soared more than 67% year to date.\\n\\nThe California-based GPU manufacturer is currently in the process of acquiring the British semiconductor technology provider Arm Ltd. The $40 billion mega-deal was announced in September 2020 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. If the American chipmaker successfully acquires Arm Ltd., NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will gain market share for global smartphone chips and enterprise servers. The stock gained 65.5% in the past twelve months.\\n\\nOn October 5, Keybank analyst John Vinh maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and increased his price target for the stock to $260 from $245. In addition, the number of hedge funds with stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) increased to 86 in the second quarter, up from 80 in Q1.\\n\\nIn the Q2 2021 investor letter of Harding Loevner, the fund mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and discussed its stance on the firm. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Within IT, shares of US-based computer chip developer NVIDIA continued their climb as rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers to cryptocurrency mining rigs-led to shortages that translated into surging prices for its chips. Such was the windfall that NVIDIA even made technical changes to some of its products to make them towards what it believes are more sustainable uses. Less attractive to cryptocurrency miners, to steer scarce supply viewed by geography, the lion’s share of excess returns came from good stock performance in the US. In addition to the contributions from NVIDIA and our health care holdings, a pair of IT software and service providers also aided relative returns.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Stocks to Buy Today.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n10 Reddit's WallStreetBets Stocks Under $5 11 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds 11 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\\n\\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy Todayis originally published on Insider Monkey.\",\n",

       " 'In general, investors tend to overweight their portfolios toward growth stocks in a bull-market. In our current bull-run, speculative meme stocks have also been in focus.

In the event of a meaningful market correction, these blue-chip stocks protect from capital erosion.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nAdditionally, most blue-chip companies have strong cash flows. Blue-chip stocks might not provide multi-fold returns in quick time. However, there is constant shareholder value creation through dividends and share repurchase.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nI believe that these stocks have upside potential in addition to an attractive dividend yield.

Valuations might be stretched in the near-term. It therefore makes sense to have exposure to some blue-chip stocks in 2022.\\n\\n10 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for 2022: Chevron Corporation (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\\n\\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAs global economic activity accelerates, it seems likely that positive momentum will sustain for oil. Exposure to the energy sector is likely to deliver returns in 2022.\\n\\nAmong blue-chip stocks, CVX stock looks particularly attractive given its investment grade balance sheet. Additionally, the stock offers investors an annualized dividend of $5.36, implying a yield of 4.68%.\\n\\nThere are two important points to note when it comes to the balance sheet and cash flow.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFirst, Chevron reported a net-debt ratio of 21% for Q2 2021. That provides ample flexibility to pursue aggressive investments in exploration to benefit from higher oil prices.\\n\\nFurthermore, the company reported operating cash flow of $7.0 billion for Q2 2021. Coupled with robust free cash flow visibility, this allows Chevron to pursue potential dividend growth and aggressive share repurchase.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that the company’s reserve replacement ratio has averaged 99% over the past few years. With a long reserve life and low break-even assets, Chevron is positioned for long-term value creation.\\n\\nJust to put things into perspective, Chevron reported positive cash flows for 2020, even after oil prices plunged due to the pandemic.\\n\\nOverall, CVX stock seems positioned for further rally in 2022. This is likely to be backed by strong cash flows and possible dividend growth.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) A close-up shot of the Apple Pay page\\n\\nSource: Bloomicon / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nYear-to-date in 2021, AAPL stock has been relatively subdued. During this period, the stock has trended higher by 12.9%. At a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 26.4, a break-out on the upside seems imminent for this cash flow king.\\n\\nAn important note is that Apple has continued to deliver strong numbers. For the fourth quarter of 2021, the company reported revenue growth of 29% to $83.4 billion. This was a new record for the September quarter.\\n\\nDiversified growth is also encouraging from a long-term perspective. Unsurprisingly, the iPhone segment remains the cash flow driver. However, Apple reported healthy growth in the wearable and services segment.\\n\\nIn the near-term, sales of the iPhone 13 are likely to ensure that growth remains robust. At the same time, Apple is looking for further diversification with a cash glut. A rumored entry into the electric vehicle segment is also an impending catalyst.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that the Americas, Europe and Greater China remain the revenue drivers in terms of regional breakdown. However, for the last 12-months, revenue growth from rest of Asia Pacific has been a strong 34%. There seems to be ample scope for penetration in emerging markets like India, among others.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nOverall, AAPL stock remains attractive from the perspective of stock upside. Additional dividend growth is likely on a sustained basis considering the cash flows.\\n\\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\\n\\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe economy of the United States is primarily driven by consumption, a key part of which is retail spending. Any list of blue-chip stocks would be incomplete without some nod to that fact.\\n\\nWMT stock, which has trended higher by just 6.8% in the last 12-months, seems like an attractive retail stock to consider, especially when you consider markets still trade near all time highs. WMT stock is a low-beta name and is worth adding to the portfolio in anticipation of any broad market correction.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the business, Walmart has aggressively pursued omni-channel sales strategy. For the current year, the company is on-track to deliver $75 billion in global ecommerce sales.\\n\\nIn a world that’s increasingly shifting to online shopping, that’s a big reason to be bullish. For Q2 2022, the ecommerce segment in the United States had a 20-basis points contribution to comparable store sales growth.\\n\\nWalmart bought a 77% stake in Flipkart (India) in 2016. The Indian ecommerce major was valued at $37.6 billion as of July 2021, valuing Walmart’s stake at nearly $29 billion. More importantly, India is still at an early stage of ecommerce growth. Walmart is positioned to benefit from presence and growth in key emerging markets.\\n\\nTesla (TSLA) A black Tesla (TSLA) Model S is parked between rows of charging stations.\\n\\nSource: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTSLA stock has witnessed a sharp rally of late. In just the past one-month, the stock has trended higher by 42%.

Gene believes that Tesla has the potential to expand its revenue from $70 billion to $400 billion in the next five years.\\n\\nThis seems entirely likely considering two important factors.\\n\\nFirst, electric vehicle adoption is still at an early stage in most parts of the world, with immense scope for revenue growth. According to Deloitte, electric car sales are likely to grow at a CAGR of 29% through 2030.\\n\\nSecond, Tesla has gigafactories in the United States and China, with a third in Europe likely to commence deliveries in 2022. The company has strong production capabilities and the market is at an inflection point of growth.\\n\\nAnother important point is that Tesla reported free cash flow of $1.3 billion for Q3 2021. Considering the revenue growth outlook, Tesla is well positioned to deliver FCF in excess of $5.0 billion on an annualized basis. This will provide financial headroom for investments and innovation.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nOverall, TSLA stock is worth buying on corrections and is among the top blue-chip stocks to hold for 2022 and beyond.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.\\n\\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMSFT stock is also among those blue-chip stocks that witnessed a strong rally in 2021. However, with strong business momentum, the stock is likely to remain in an uptrend.\\n\\nRecently, Microsoft reported results of Q1 2022. The company’s revenue growth was 22% at $45.3 billion. It’s worth noting that Microsoft Cloud reported revenue growth of 36% for the quarter to $20.7 billion.\\n\\nClearly, the cloud business growth has remained strong, contributing nearly 50% of total revenue. The cloud business is likely to ensure that top-line growth remains robust.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that Microsoft reported cash and equivalents of $130 billion as of September 2021. Earlier this year, the company acquired Nuance Communications. The acquisition will help the company accelerate its cloud strategy for healthcare. With a strong cash buffer, it’s likely that Microsoft will continue to pursue acquisitions to drive growth.\\n\\nMicrosoft returned $10.9 billion to shareholders in Q1 2022 through dividends and share repurchase. Considering the cash flows and the balance sheet health, aggressive repurchasing should continue.\\n\\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\\n\\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe defense sector is relatively immune to economic shocks. Even during the pandemic, global defense spending increased to touch nearly $2 trillion in 2020.\\n\\nAmong defense stocks, LMT stock looks attractive. Currently, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 13.4, with a robust dividend yield of 3.37% and sustainable dividends.\\n\\nFor Q3 2021, Lockheed reported sales of $16 billion. The company has guided for $67 billion in sales for 2021 and $66 billion in sales for 2022. The current order backlog of $135 billion provides clear revenue visibility.\\n\\nAn important point to note is that Lockheed has guided for operating cash flow of $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion for 2021 and 2022 respectively. This is likely to ensure that dividends sustain in addition to continued share repurchase.\\n\\nFrom a backlog growth perspective, Lockheed has seen significant growth in orders from outside the United States. With NATO allies still falling short of the defense spending target, it’s likely that order intake will remain strong.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nOverall, LMT stock has been an underperformer over the last 12-months. The stock trend is likely to reverse in 2022 as markets search for value.\\n\\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer (PFE) logo on the windows of a corporate building\\n\\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nPFE stock is another undervalued name among blue-chip stocks that can potentially rally in 2022. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 10.8 and offers investors a dividend yield of 3.57%.\\n\\nFor Q2 2021, Pfizer reported robust revenue growth of 86%, which was largely driven by the Covid-19 vaccine. But even without the impact of the vaccine, revenue growth was 10%. Furthermore, with a deep pipeline of drugs, Pfizer expects revenue growth at a CAGR of 6% through 2025.\\n\\nAn important point to note is that for 2021, Pfizer expects revenue of $33.5 billion from the Covid-19 vaccine. The company expects to deliver 2.1 billion doses of the vaccine through the year. Additionally, Pfizer has boosted its manufacturing capacity to three billion doses for 2022.\\n\\nRecently, the company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the use of Covid-19 vaccine in children aged 5-11 years. This is likely to ensure that cash flow from Covid-19 vaccine sales remains strong through 2022.\\n\\nIn terms of growth, Pfizer recently acquired Trillium Therapeutics for $2.26 billion, an acquisition that diversifies the company’s oncology pipeline. With strong cash flows expected in the coming quarters, Pfizer has financial flexibility for acquisition driven growth.\\n\\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX) Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.\\n\\nSource: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWith renewed global economic growth and accelerating inflation, I would also be remiss not to include a commodity stock in my list of blue-chip stocks. FCX stock has trended higher by more than 100% in the last 12-months. However, at a forward P/E of 12.4, the stock looks attractive for further upside.\\n\\nFreeport-McMoRan is also attractive with copper emerging as a key investment theme. Be it electric cars or renewable energy, the application of copper is likely to increase in the coming decade. Freeport-McMoRan seems well positioned to benefit from this tailwind.\\n\\nWith higher copper sales and realization, Freeport-McMoRan reported adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion for Q3 2021. For the same period, the company’s net-debt declined to $2.0 billion. With a strong balance sheet, capital expenditure is likely to remain aggressive. At the same time, dividends are sustainable.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nAnother important point to note is that Freeport-McMoRan expects higher copper sales in 2022 and 2023. At $5/lb copper price, the company has guided for EBITDA of $17 billion. With a robust outlook for 2022, FCX stock is likely to remain in an uptrend.\\n\\nJP Morgan Chase (JPM) A sign for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM).\\n\\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI believe that banking stocks are also likely to be among the outperformers in 2022. JPM stock is attractively valued at a forward P/E of 11.3 and offers an annualized dividend of $4 per share to boot.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that the first rate-hike after the pandemic is likely to occur in 2022. As economic activity trends towards potential GDP, the banking sector is likely to benefit with growth in the core banking business.\\n\\nTo keep things in perspective, JP Morgan reported net interest income of $13.2 billion for Q3 2021. For the same period, the company’s non-interest revenue was $17.3 billion.\\n\\nInvestment banking and wealth management divisions have been cash flow drivers in a low interest rate environment. Going forward, it’s likely that interest income will increase. This is a key trigger for JPM stock upside.\\n\\nIt was recently reported that U.S. regulators are exploring the possibility of banks holding cryptocurrencies. Any meaningful progress on this front can be considered another upside catalyst for the banking sector. Looking at current valuations, JPM stock might be positioned for another rally relatively soon.\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logistics center in Szczecin, Poland.\\n\\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAMZN stock has been another underperforming name among blue-chip stocks in 2021. However, there is no doubt that the stock is likely to remain in a long-term uptrend.\\n\\nRecently, Amazon reported Q3 2021 results and there are several positive factors to talk about. Net sales increased by 15% on a year-on-year basis to $110.8 billion. Importantly, the sales growth momentum has sustained for Amazon Web Services (39% y-o-y growth). AWS is likely to remain a key growth driver in the coming quarters.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that for the last twelve-months, the company reported operating cash flow of $54.7 billion. With strong cash flows, the company has the financial flexibility to pursue organic and acquisition driven growth. Over the past year, Amazon has spent $34.9 billion in acquisitions.\\n\\nOn the flipside, most retail companies are pursuing an aggressive omni-channel growth strategy. The competition in the e-commerce space seems to be intensifying. However, Amazon has continued to invest in service and technology. Further, with presence in several emerging markets, the company’s ecommerce segment will remain a cash flow generator.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul\\n\\nOverall, it seems likely that AMZN stock will trend higher in 2022 after a meaningful period of consolidation.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Microsoft said last year it would await federal regulation before selling facial recognition technology to police.\\n\\nPolice in the United States and Britain use facial recognition to identify suspects. But a study by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology found the technology is not as accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces.\\n\\nLast year, the first known wrongful arrest based on an incorrect facial recognition occurred in the United States. The United Nations has cited the case, attributed to the fact that the tool had mostly been trained on white faces, as an example of the dangers posed by a lack of diversity in the tech sector.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\\'SOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE\\'\\n\\n\"They (tech companies) have to be very careful because technology has the ability to expedite values that otherwise would come about more slowly,\" Tometi said. \"But technology speeds everything up so the impact will be worse, faster.\"\\n\\nUrging software developers to \"pay attention to all details\", she said they should hear Black people more.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately I feel like tech companies have a long way to go to build a bridge with the community,\" she said.\\n\\nAccording to the digital advocacy group Algorithmic Justice League, one of the reasons why AI systems are not inclusive is the predominantly white male composition of developer teams.\\n\\nOne of the hundreds of of AI-driven startups that attended the Web Summit, Europe\\'s largest tech event, was Brazil\\'s NeuralMind, which specialises in product development.\\n\\nCEO Patricia Tavares echoed Tometi\\'s concerns, saying that although AI brings benefits to society, there was a need for \"legislation to make sure companies use it in a responsible and ethical way\".\\n\\nNot far from NeuralMind\\'s stand, the CEO of health tracking platform Revolab, Kalinas Ovidijus, said his startup\\'s market was Nordic and Baltic nations and that most of the data they have access to, provided by local hospitals and health centres, was on white people.\\n\\nThey were unsure if the platform would be able to meet the health needs of people of colour.\\n\\n\"We need solutions for the future, for future challenges, but those solutions need to be very inclusive,\" Tometi said. \"They need to protect marginalised and vulnerable communities - that\\'s their duty.\" (Reporting by Catarina Demony; Additional reporting by Miguel Pereira and Pedro Nunes; Editing by Andrei Khalip, Alison Willliams and Gareth Jones)',\n",

Dohmke, the chief product officer, will become CEO effective Nov. 15. Dohmke was the co-founder of mobile development app HockeyApp and joined Microsoft when the software maker acquired his company. While at Microsoft, he led the GitHub acquisition process from an engineering standpoint, according to an email from Microsoft cloud chief Scott Guthrie to employees seen by Bloomberg. Dohmke will report to Liuson, who is being promoted to president of Microsoft’s developer division.\\n\\n“When we acquired GitHub in 2018, we knew it was critical that we do our very best to serve developers everywhere. Three years later, I couldn’t be prouder of the team’s progress,” Guthrie wrote in the email, noting GitHub’s users have nearly tripled to 73 million from 28 million.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s acquisition of code repository GitHub for $7.5 billion in 2018 marked a return to its roots as a software development tools company as well as showing the company’s growing desire to use that business to bolster its ambitions in areas like cloud cloud and artificial intelligence.\\n\\nThe deal provoked some concerns among users about whether Microsoft would meddle with or ruin GitHub, particularly given Microsoft’s historical antipathy toward open source development, or hamper projects that rival Microsoft’s key products. But with Microsoft already shifting to become a large open source developer itself, those concerns have largely failed to materialize. Instead, Friedman has worked with Microsoft rivals as needed, attracted enterprise customers to GitHub and focused on ways to professionalize open source software development and create a path for code-writers to get paid for their efforts.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThere has been the occasional culture clash between the two companies as when GitHub employees protested a contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Friedman told an internal meeting that GitHub was beholden to Microsoft’s policies on the issue.\\n\\nFriedman, who co-founded Xamarin and sold it to Microsoft about six years ago, will become GitHub’s chairman emeritus.\\n\\n(Updates with comments from executive in the third paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nPapa John Is Still Obsessed With Papa John’s The Amazon Is Fast Approaching a Point of No Return Big Teacher Is Watching: How AI Spyware Took Over Schools The Slip-and-Fall King Wants to Save You From Your Next Wipeout Australia Braces for Life After Covid Zero\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

(NYSE:NET) is an American internet and cloud computing company, focused on web infrastructure and website security. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) allows protection of external, public-facing web properties, secures internal operations and private data, and also offers a server-less platform to customers so they can build scalable applications without deploying web infrastructure. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of the top tech stock picks of Adam Parker’s Center Lake Capital.\\n\\nCloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is quite popular among hedge funds, with 43 funds long Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) at the end of June. Center Lake Capital owns stakes worth $24.8 million in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), which represents 3.57% of Parker’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nCowen analyst Shaul Eyal kept an Outperform rating on Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), raising the price target from $135 to $200 on October 19. He is expecting solid results from the web security company, now that Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is prioritizing digital transformation, information asset protection, and compliance accelerating revenue growth.\\n\\nCloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is a top technology stock in Adam Parker’s 13F portfolio, just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.

Cloudflare’s intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in over 100 countries. It offers network security, performance and reliability to a growing portion of global web traffic with over 17% of global internet requests going through Cloudflare. The company’s serverless network design allows this global network to be a key component layer as new developments for edge computing, 5G and the Internet of Things increase the importance of secure, reliable edge networks.\\n\\nCloudflare stock outperformed in the second quarter following a strong earnings report for the first three months of this year during which the company reaccelerated revenue growth. This revenue reacceleration was driven by momentum in Cloudflare’s large customer segment. Cloudflare added a record number of large customers who now account for more than half of Cloudflare’s total revenue. We think that Cloudflare is currently still in the early stages of market penetration, which means it has potential to maintain high levels of growth within its large customer segment as the company continues to innovate within its product offerings to better serve these large, complex customers. Cloudflare’s leadership in product innovation was further validated by the company’s second quarter announcement of a new partnership with NVIDIA Corporation to develop Al-based applications on Cloudflare’s edge network.”\\n\\n9.

(NASDAQ:EVBG), up from 49 in the previous quarter with stakes worth over $1.08 billion.\\n\\nBaron Discovery Fund mentioned Everbridge Inc. (NASDAQ:EVBG) in their Q1 2021 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Everbridge, Inc. provides a cloud-based software solution to companies for critical event management (“CEM”) as well as general population alerts for public authorities. Shares declined during the first quarter as part of the broader market rotation from high-valuation software stocks coupled with continued pandemic-related pressure on Everbridge’s organic growth rates. We retain conviction given the company’s significant lead over its competition and the early stage of CEM adoption, with just 2% of Everbridge’s 5,000-plus population alert customers having adopted CEM thus far.”\\n\\n7.

       " 'In this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of Imran Khan’s Proem Advisors. You can skip our detailed analysis of Khan’s history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, and go directly to the Top 5 Stock Picks of Imran Khan\\'s Proem Advisors.\\n\\nImran Khan founded Proem Advisors in 2018 and serves as the chief investment officer at the asset management firm. Khan is extremely focused on technology-driven ideas, innovative investment opportunities, strong returns, and alpha opportunities. His 13F portfolio comprises stocks from information technology, finance, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 74%.\\n\\nImran Khan is also the co-founder, controlling owner, and CEO of Verishop, which is an online shopping platform housing several independent clothing and lifestyle brands. Formerly, he was the chief strategy officer at Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), where he was managing revenue, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, strategy, and human resources. Before that, Khan served at Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) as head of global internet investment banking, from 2011 to 2015. In 2004, Imran Khan joined JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), where he was the head of global internet equity research, and a top ranked analyst, till 2011. Khan holds a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Denver, specializing in Finance and Economics.\\n\\nKhan’s investment strategy revolves around concentrated long/short equity investments, and he seeks aggressive growth via capital appreciation over a market cycle, while simultaneously working to preserve capital in down markets. Imran Khan’s experience as a research analyst for tech companies, investment banker, operator, and company founder allows him to capitalize on market investment opportunities, and make educated investment decisions.\\n\\nCurrently, Khan’s Proem Advisors manages $127.4 million in managed 13F securities, with the largest holding being MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), which represents 12.71% of Khan’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\\n\\nWhy should we pay attention to Imran Khan’s stock picks? Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and July 2021, our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 186.1%, vs. 100.1% for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 86 percentage points (see the details here). That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWith this context in mind, here are some of the top stock picks of  Imran Khan’s Proem Advisors. We used Proem Advisors’ 13F portfolio for the second quarter of 2021 to rank these stocks. The list was compiled according to the value of each holding in the investment portfolio.\\n\\nThe analyst ratings for each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was gauged using the data of 873 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\\n\\nTop Stock Picks of Imran Khan’s Proem Advisors\\n\\n10. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)\\n\\nProem Advisors’ Stake Value: $5,970,000\\n\\nPercentage of Proem Advisors’ 13F Portfolio: 4.68%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\\n\\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) is a Norwegian cruise line brand, founded in 1968. It operates out of Miami, and is the largest cruise line by revenue. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) has an active fleet of 24 ships as of 2021, and some of the famous destinations the cruise ships frequently cover include the Caribbean, Greece and Greek Isles, Bermuda, Italy, New England, and Mexico, among others.\\n\\nAs of the end of June, 42 hedge funds were long Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL).\\n\\n9. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU)\\n\\nProem Advisors’ Stake Value: $7,164,000\\n\\nPercentage of Proem Advisors’ 13F Portfolio: 5.62%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\\n\\nFutu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a digital brokerage and wealth management platform operating in China, Hong Kong, and the United States, among other international locations. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) leverages advanced tech to transform the investing experience for clients. The main services at Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) include stock trading and clearing, margin financing, wealth management, market data and information, and interactive social features for Hong Kong, US, China Connect and Singapore stocks.\\n\\nOn October 19, CLSA analyst Ethan Wang initiated coverage of Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) with a Buy rating, setting a price target of $110. Wang predicts that getting a clearing license in the US will boost short-term margins.\\n\\nFutu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a good investment opportunity, just like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\n\\nHere is what Tao Value has to say about Futu Holdings Limited in their Q1 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Futu is a new “Opportunistic” position. It is an HK based online brokerage & wealth management platform with deep root in technology. Futu sits in the confluence of 3 strong favorable forces of Meteorology, Topography & Commander, yet was underpriced at the time of our entry. In terms of Meteorology, there is a huge addressable market of Chinese domestic middle to upper classes’ wealth being deployed to overseas assets allocation in the next decade. Additionally, the incumbents being disrupted are extremely weak in their digital transformation. On Topography, Futu’s user-centric product design built an intuitive front end and great user experience, while the digital native development framework built a solid & reliable back end (including a self-developed order routing & execution system for the HK market). This is a rare combination compared to both offline incumbents (who lack flashy front end & UX) & other new online disrupters (who lack solid infrastructure). On Commander factor, founder CEO Li Hua was a Tencent engineer in its early days with deep knowledge in product design and development. Li is said to be a fanatic product manager, to this day still at the front-line, alpha testing any new features. Based on analyses of these factors, I think Futu could compound its revenue at a very high rate with very high certainty and with strong operating leverage, putting our entry price very attractive compared to earning power in 3-5 years. Yet just as we finished building a small position, the price started to take off and more than tripled in a month. When such price action happens, it is obvious that Mr. Market has turned very euphoric to this name. I decided to trim but kept a reasonable position given its growth certainty.”\\n\\n8. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)\\n\\nProem Advisors’ Stake Value: $7,305,000\\n\\nPercentage of Proem Advisors’ 13F Portfolio: 5.73%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\\n\\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a Canadian e-commerce mega company, operating as a multinational platform for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) further facilitates its digital store owners by offering services likepayments, marketing, shipping and customer engagement tools. The company has over 1700,000 listed businesses across 175 countries, as of 2021. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is one of the top stock picks of Imran Khan’s Proem Advisors.\\n\\nProem Advisors owns 5,000 shares in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), worth $7.3 million, representing 5.73% of Khan’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 85 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported owning stakes in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), worth $13.97 billion.\\n\\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what they said:\\n\\n“Shopify (is one of the) companies that have become go-to platforms for small and medium size businesses (SMBs) engaged in e-commerce and social media marketing, rebounded strongly in the quarter after being caught in the selloff among high-multiple growth names since Vaccine Monday. These and the portfolio’s other disruptors had thrived through the first part of the pandemic, leading us to trim positions into strength and reallocate cash into more attractively priced evolving opportunities and steady compounders that had been overly punished by lockdowns and a drop in economic activity.”\\n\\n7. Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI)\\n\\nProem Advisors’ Stake Value: $7,310,000\\n\\nPercentage of Proem Advisors’ 13F Portfolio: 5.73%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\\n\\nBilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) is a Chinese video sharing website, with the content theme focused on animation, comics, and games. Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) has expanded its content to cater to a larger audience, by streaming videos on demand, including famous documentaries, variety shows, and various original productions. Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) is one of Imran Khan’s top stock picks.\\n\\nProem Advisors’ owns stakes worth $7.31 million in Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) as of the end of Q2, which accounts for 5.73% of Khan’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nAt the end of June, 47 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported owning stakes in Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI), down from 53 in Q1.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst Alex Poon kept an Overweight rating on Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI), with a price target of $100 on October 18. Poon stated that the Q3 revenue was projected to grow 16% quarter-over-quarter, and 64% year-over-year.\\n\\nHere is what Baillie Gifford has to say about Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“One of the most important cognitive elements is our recognition that consumer patterns and attitudes are evolving increasingly rapidly and with ever greater amplitude. While the human needs for self-actualisation, esteem and belonging are innate and immutable, they are being expressed in new ways. Tastes are being shaped by social groups who are culturally similar but geographically distant. The lines between the physical and digital-self continue to blur.\\n\\nTo those in the throes of middle age, this can be discombobulating. I profess to unease when my daughter recently earned five pounds stacking logs – only to ‘blow’ this pocket money on a pair of virtual Gucci sneakers for her online Roblox character. But we need to be imaginative about the possible size of the market for virtual luxury in the long term and it’s encouraging to observe that Kering is already on the front foot. It is also amply clear that the experienced Long Term Global Growth investors who predate Generations Y & Z, need the help of colleagues in understanding the mood and aspirations of a new cohort of conscious consumers. In this sense, the multigenerational and multicultural dynamic within the LTGG team (and indeed across the broader Baillie Gifford investment floor), has never seemed more important.\\n\\nMeanwhile, it was our Shanghai-based colleagues who patiently educated us on the potential for the new holding in Bilibili – the fastest growing mainstream entertainment portal for Chinese teenagers and young adults. Bilibili’s range of video, gaming and anime comic content is formidable (and hugely under monetised) but the registration process for any budding Bilibili curator or commentator involves a test with one hundred multiple choice questions on topics including copyrights, commentary etiquette, platform neologism and – à la Mastermind – niche questions based on topics of the entrant’s choosing. To western observers, this is bemusing because every successful social platform in the west is focussed on reducing registration friction. But for Bilibili, the initiation ritual of the entrance exam cements the bond that users have with the platform, aligning them with the existing community to drive a stickier user base and fewer trolls – a dynamic that is so easy for a cognitively narrow stock market to overlook.”\\n\\n6. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)\\n\\nProem Advisors’ Stake Value: $7,621,000\\n\\nPercentage of Proem Advisors’ 13F Portfolio: 5.98%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\\n\\nPinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is the largest online agricultural marketplace in China. They have, to date, helped about 16 million farmers digitize their selling process, and reach customers easily. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)’s main strategic focus is to improve the agricultural supply chain across the country. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of Imran Khan’s top stock picks.\\n\\nProem Advisors’ owns 60,000 shares in Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), valued at $7.62 million, making up 5.98% of Khan’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nAt the end of Q2, 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), down from 56 in the previous quarter.\\n\\nLike Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the best stocks in Proem Advisors’ Q2 portfolio.\\n\\nHere is what Baillie Gifford has to say about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n\"As many countries enjoy a relaxation of Covid restrictions, Mr Market is focussed on short-term beneficiaries of ‘the pleasure after the plague’. There are interesting parallels with the Roaring 20s here, but to our minds, they extend beyond post-pandemic hedonism. Much of the new wealth created in the 1920s was patchily distributed and accompanied by a pervasive sense that the older generation had let down younger people. In 1920, John F. Carter, an irate 23-year-old wrote “the older generation had certainly pretty well ruined this world before passing it on to us. We have been forced to live in an atmosphere of ‘tomorrow we die,’ and so, naturally, we drank and were merry.”\\n\\nIn a similar vein, some of the greatest Growth opportunities are materialising from the companies that are shifting humankind towards more sustainable ways of consuming by driving efficiencies and eliminating surplus. Pinduoduo’s ‘farm to table’ platform is one example – cutting out huge waste in farm produce and short circuiting layers of infrastructure by matching Chinese food supply and demand through a group buying model. In a similar vein, Meituan is well on the way to developing China’s primary ‘Software as a Service’ ecosystem for food distribution which we believe has a strong chance of replacing wasteful wet markets as the primary channel for transacting in produce.\\n\\nPinduoduo’s share price pulled back following news that Chinese regulators are investigating possible anti-competitive activities by the country’s large online companies. However, Pinduoduo appears well placed to navigate such regulatory scrutiny in the long-term, helped in part by its community buying business model that benefits consumers, manufacturers and farmers alike. Its business fundamentals are stellar– the company remains the largest Chinese e-commerce platform, with over 820 million annual active users (surpassing Alibaba and JD.com), while revenue growth increased by 239% over the previous year.\"\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 5 Stock Picks of Imran Khan\\'s Proem Advisors.

       " \"Wall Street is having an impressive bull run in 2021 with just eight weeks of trading left. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — recorded new all-time highs in each of the last three trading days. This has happened for the first time since December 2019.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on Nov 1, the Dow touched a key milestone of 36,000 for the first time. On Nov 2, the blue-chip index closed above 36,000 for the first time. The momentum is likely to continue in the near future as the market is likely to see a year-end rally buoyed by the upcoming holiday sales season, which is expected to beat expectations.\\n\\nEncouraging Dow Rally in 2021\\n\\nIn 2020, the Dow had gained 7.3% compared with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composites rallies of 16.3% and 43.6%, respectively. However, in 2021, market participants’ preferences have shifted from overvalued growth-oriented technology stocks to relatively undervalued cyclical stocks.\\n\\nAs the composition of the Dow leans toward cyclical stocks, the index gained momentum in 2021. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 17.8%, 23.3% and 21.4%, respectively.\\n\\nAt its current level of 36,052.63, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 34,945.59 and 33,836.45, respectively. The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.\\n\\nIt is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.\\n\\nNear-Term Catalysts\\n\\nFirst, market valuation has already discounted the likelihood of the Fed starting to taper its monthly bond-buy program this year. The current projection by the CME FedWatch shows a 7% probability that the central bank will hike the benchmark interest rate in early 2022. The Fed has maintained that a rate hike is unlikely before the second half of 2022.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSecond, on Nov 2, the initial estimation of the Atlanta Fed was that the U.S. economy will grow 8.1% in fourth-quarter 2021 after rising 2% in the third quarter. On Oct 29, the initial estimate for fourth-quarter GDP was 6.6%.\\n\\nThe U.S. GDP grew 6.4% and 6.7%, in the first and second quarter of this year, respectively. Moreover, robust U.S. corporate earnings in the first, second and third quarters bolstered market participants’ confidence in U.S. equities.\\n\\nThird, a strong reduction in the news cases of the Delta variant will pave the way for robust holiday sales. On Oct 28, the FDA approved the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. PFE and BioNTech SE BNTX for children of age 5 to 11. More than 28 million U.S. kids will now get the vaccine.\\n\\nHoliday retail sales are likely to climb this year as projected by various major market researchers like Deloitte, Mastercard SpendingPulse, Bain and KPMG. Notably, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP.\\n\\nFourth, on Oct 28, President Joe Biden announced that he reached a deal with Senate Democrats on the outlines of a $1.75 trillion social spending and climate bill. He appealed to House Democrats to vote for the stalled $1 trillion infrastructure bill that already passed the Senate.\\n\\nFifth, U.S. consumers have regained confidence in the economy. The Conference Board reported that the U.S. consumer confidence index climbed to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September, beating the consensus estimate of 107.5. The index rebounded after three consecutive months of decline.\\n\\nMore importantly, the expectations sub-index (consumers’ outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions for the next 6 months) improved to 91.3 in October from 86.7 in September.\\n\\nOur Top Picks\\n\\nWe have narrowed down our search to five Dow stocks with strong growth potential for the ensuing quarter. All these stocks witnessed robust earnings estimate revisions in the last 7 to 30 days, indicating solid business prospects. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\n\\nhe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nChevron Corp. CVX is one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve a sustainable production ramp-up. Its existing project pipeline is one of the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\\n\\nChevron’s Noble Energy takeover has expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings improved 2% over the last 7 days.\\n\\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT is introducing new and improved Surface devices that could encourage enterprises to stick with Windows as they move toward BYOD and cloud computing. Microsoft’s advantages in this respect are two-fold.\\n\\nFirst, the company has a huge installed base of Office users. Most legacy data are based on Office, so enterprises are usually reluctant to use other productivity solutions. Second, the BYOD model is dependent on security and cloud integration, both of which are Microsoft’s strengths.\\n\\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.3% for the quarter ending December 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings improved 4.1% over the last 7 days.\\n\\nDow Inc. DOW should gain from cost synergy savings and productivity initiatives. The company is focused on maintaining cost and operational discipline through cost synergy and stranded cost-removal initiatives. Its actions to reduce operating costs are expected to lend support to its earnings in 2021.\\n\\nDow’s restructuring program is also expected to deliver margin benefits. Investment in high-return projects should also be accretive to its earnings. Management is investing in several high-return growth projects including the expansion of downstream silicones capacity.\\n\\nThis Zacks Rank #1 company has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the quarter ending December 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings improved 12% over the last 30 days.\\n\\nMcDonald's Corp. MCD has been making every effort to drive growth in the international markets. McDonald’s is the world’s largest chain of fast-food restaurants in more than 100 countries. Its offerings have reached the billion-dollar brand status through sustained product innovation and geographic expansion.\\n\\nWith an almost 10% share of the global informal-eating-out market, there is ample scope for it to grow in the future as it boasts a scale advantage compared to its peers. Growing guest count remains the company’s top priority and it intends to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value. Moreover, McDonald’s expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth over the long term.\\n\\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 35.9% for the quarter ending December 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings improved 3.6% over the last 7 days.\\n\\nThe Home Depot Inc. HD is witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the “One Home Depot” investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.\\n\\nAmid the pandemic, customers have been increasingly blending the physical and digital elements of the shopping experience, making the interconnected One Home Depot strategy most relevant. The company is effectively adapting to the demand for renovations and construction activities, driven by prudent investments. It is gaining from growth in Pro and DIY customer categories as well as digital momentum.\\n\\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 3.7% for the quarter ending January 2022.

       " \"After an incredible 66% gain during the month of October, does Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) stock have any juice left in the tank? Close up of Cloudflare logo at the Company's headquarters\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIt’s been a mind blowing run for San Francisco-based cybersecurity company. Cloudflare specializes in website security has seen its share price rally 128% over the past six months. At its current price of just over $190 a share, NET stock is now up 268% in the last 52 weeks.\\n\\nAnd despite repeated calls from analysts for the stock to course correct, it has continued to defy the skeptics and keeps marching higher. While the median price target on the stock is currently $130, which would represent a 32% decline from current levels, there remain some on Wall Street who feel Cloudflare stock has more steam in its engine and could vault over $200 in coming weeks.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nHuge Growth Opportunities\\n\\nCloudflare is one of the newer cybersecurity stocks. The company only went public in September 2019. Since its initial public offering, NET stock has gained 960%, trouncing the gains of most other technology companies.\\n\\nThe main reason for the stellar returns has been Cloudflare’s focus on cloud computing security. The company is positioned as a service provider and it works to bolster the speed, reliability, and security of its clients’ websites. The market in which Cloudflare operates is growing quickly and positioned for explosive growth in coming years. The company has forecast that its worldwide addressable market will reach $100 billion by 2024.\\n\\n7 Tech Stocks to Buy for Q4 Earnings Season\\n\\nIt is that huge and expanding market that is the reason Cloudflare’s compound annual growth rate averaged 50% between 2016 and 2020. While most companies growth trajectory would level off after such a run, Cloudflare’s growth has accelerated. Its revenues grew 53% year-over-year in its most recent quarter. That accelerating growth rate is what helped to push NET stock up more than 65% in the month of October this year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe company now has 1,088 large customers globally (those that spend more than $100,000 with the company) and boasts a retention rate of 90%, meaning that those customers are renewing their services with Cloudflare.\\n\\nReason for Caution\\n\\nThe October rise in NET stock was underpinned by the company’s announcement that it has formed a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other companies such as Yandex(NASDAQ:YNDX) to make their online search engines faster and provide more timely results. The arrangement with the various search engines gives a boost to Cloudflare’s value proposition.\\n\\nThe company claims it will notify Microsoft’s Bing, and other search engines, when content is created, updated, or deleted, helping them more efficiently align searches across the internet. Search engine optimization is a service Cloudflare says it plans to perfect and market to businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nWhile Cloudflare’s growth and share price appreciation have been nothing short of spectacular, there are reasons for investors to be cautious with NET stock. First of all, Cloudflare now has a market capitalization of more than $56 billion and a price-sales ratio of 89, which makes it one of the most expensive stocks not only among cybersecurity companies but the entire stock market.\\n\\nTo give an idea of how overpriced Cloudflare’s stock is currently, consider that its closest competitor, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY), has a price-sales ratio of 16. Cloudflare’s valuation is now five times bigger than Fastly’s and the two companies have, basically, the same revenue growth.\\n\\nAdditionally, while Cloudflare has been growing leaps and bounds, the company remains unprofitable. While it is not unusual for young, fast growing companies to be unprofitable, particularly in the technology space, investors should be wary of red ink. Cloudflare has forecast that it will report a loss of $28 million to $24 million on revenue of up to $633 million this year.\\n\\nWait On NET Stock\\n\\nCloudflare next reports quarterly results on Nov. 4. The company’s stock has been rallying in the lead-up to its next earnings and could sell off immediately after its financials are made public.\\n\\nEven if it doesn’t sell off now, it is clear that the stock is at a sky high valuation and is extremely expensive as it approaches $200 a share. Add in the fact that the company is unprofitable and its massive year-to-date run of 158%, and there is every reason to believe that Cloudflare’s stock will pullback in the near term\\n\\nInvestors who missed the current rally should wait for the stock to decline to $150 per share or lower. Watch for a bottom and then try to catch the next rally higher. Right now, NET stock is not a buy.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

       " 'GLASGOW — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a \"wholesale transformation\" of carbon intensive economies at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow on Wednesday, urging the private sector to capitalize on an opportunity to help developing nations transition to a carbon free economy.\\n\\n\"Rising to this challenge will require the wholesale transformation of our carbon-intensive economies,\" Yellen stated in prepared remarks. \"It’s a global transition for which we have an estimated price tag: some have put the global figure between $100 and $150 trillion over the next three decades. At the same time, addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity of our time.\"\\n\\nYahoo Finance and Yahoo News will be reporting from COP26, which is set to begin on October 31 and last until November 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. Check out the coverage here.\\n\\nYellen specifically pledged U.S. support for Climate Investment Funds (CIF), a multilateral climate finance mechanism to help the poorest countries most affected by climate change, build out climate resilience, and shift to a future free of fossil fuels.\\n\\n“Through an innovative leveraging structure, this initiative will help attract significant new private climate finance and provide $500 million per year for the Clean Technology Funds’ programming, including the new Accelerating Coal Transition investment Program,” Yellen stated.\\n\\nFinancing for developing countries have increasingly become a contentious point of larger climate discussions, with a $100 billion pledge by the world’s advanced economies yet to be paid out more than five years after it was initially promised.\\n\\nDeveloping countries argue they are being unfairly tasked to pay for a climate crisis largely caused by emissions spewed by the world’s richest countries, while the poorest nations have been hit the hardest by extreme weather brought on by climate change.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry admitted $100 billion would not be enough given that the climate crisis is intensifying and time is running out to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, a goal climate scientists have said would avert a catastrophe.\\n\\n“$100 billion doesn\\'t do it, folks,\" Kerry said. \"It\\'s trillions of dollars that are needed. And the only way we will get this done is if trillions of dollars are forthcoming.\"\\n\\nPresident Biden has already announced a U.S. commitment to quadruple international climate finance by 2024, to more than $11 billion. The private sector is expected to pick up the bulk of the investments, because of the sheer scale and cost of the effort needed to sunset coal powered plants and invest in renewable energy, among other measures.\\n\\nYellen stated the private sector stands \"ready to supply the financing\" to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. Some of the world’s largest multinational companies, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as asset managers have made the trip to Glasgow to seek investment opportunities in the green transition.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference with Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe at Government buildings in Dublin, Ireland, November 1, 2021. (REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne)\\n\\nHowever, commercial banks have been slow to line up capital for projects. While Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) have committed to shifting its investments to businesses that reduce carbon emissions, major banks from India, China, Japan, and Australia haven’t followed.\\n\\nYellen, who mentioned \"investments that will be profitable in sustainable investments\" to Congressional testimony last month, asserted in her COP26 remarks that \"it is simply cost effective to go green.\"\\n\\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Yellen, released a report last month laying out actions needed to build resilience in the financial system from the risk of climate change, including enhanced climate-related disclosures.\\n\\n“CEOs representing trillions in assets are here to show their commitment,\" Yellen stated. \"Financial institutions with collective assets under management of nearly $100 trillion have come together under The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ.

The logo and information for the Wish (WISH stock) mobile app are displayed on a smartphone.\\n\\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLet’s take a close look at what’s happening to WISH shares. After, I’ll offer a risk-adjusted determination aligned with those findings.\\n\\nQuick Background on WISH Stock\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Costco (NASDAQ:COST). McDonalds (NYSE:MCD). Each of these are titans of commerce. Each company is also a prime example that investor action can trump wishful thinking alone in forceful ways.

Well, that is of course until one takes a gander at WISH stock.\\n\\nShares of ContextLogic are off 73% year-to-date. In fact, they’re just 12% — a meager 60 cents — removed from their all-time-low. It hardly seems fair, right?\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nWISH stock’s significant 32% bearish short interest certainly won’t see it that way. And to be perfectly fair, it would be hard to argue against those wagering against ContextLogic’s shares this year.\\n\\nNotoriously cheaper quality goods or novelty knickknacks? That’s what one is buying into when they purchase WISH stock.\\n\\nThe risks get a little uglier when you consider that much of Wish’s merchant offerings come from China and it has experienced Covid-related supply chain bottlenecks. Its purchases also come with an iffy return and refund process. No thanks to WISH stock, right?\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIt wasn’t always that way though.\\n\\nContextLogic’s History With Reddit\\n\\nFor this year’s fast money Reddit crowd WISH stock was, at one time, every bit the investment opportunity. But those rules of engagement have little to do with company longevity and business prospects and everything related to short-squeeze scheming.\\n\\nAnd for a short while the trade worked. Briefly.\\n\\nIn January as Reddit’s apes began to make a name for themselves with over-the-top squeezes in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) headlining, WISH stock managed a respectable 80% surge. But those days are long since gone.\\n\\nUnlike GME, AMC stock and other squeeze trades which have put refreshed cash war chests to good use and pivoted themselves for turnarounds, WISH has proven a house of pain for shareholders believing there was something more to ContextLogic.\\n\\nBallooning red ink, rising costs, sharp declines in tchotchke growth metrics like app installs and average user time have conspired against WISH stock and its ape base. At least for those that bothered to stick around for August’s dismal Q2 report.\\n\\nThe fact is shares were already a mess and down big-time from their January high when ContextLogic delivered atrocious results fitting for bears wearing shorts in WISH stock. And those traders ran with the report as WISH slumped more than 20% to all-time-lows, while bulls were sent packing.\\n\\nWISH Stock Weekly Price Chart ContextLogic (WISH) bear flag which could turn into a bear trap supported by improving stochastics\\n\\nSource: Charts by TradingView\\n\\nToday and with shares down another 30% or so from August’s fallout, WISH stock has the technical look of cheap merchandise that bulls may look to try on. But don’t expect a lasting reaction. If you’re like me, you look at Wish’s business with skepticism, so what I’m proposing isn’t a long-term trade.\\n\\nStill, a weekly chart bear flag stationed off ContextLogic’s lows could turn into a bear trap as evidenced by a much-improved stochastics indicator. And next week, an earnings release that’s better-than-feared or maybe offers an upside surprise could be a trigger for a shorter, but significant rally.\\n\\nFor those with accounts that have money allocated for more speculative ventures, an appropriately sized long Nov or Dec $6 call looks like a decent way to position.\\n\\nIf I’m right about WISH stock’s near-term prospects, those slightly out-of-the-money contracts could go firmly in-the-money and offer solid, leveraged profits. And in the event ContextLogic delivers an authentic bear flag that works, bulls won’t need snorkel gear to survive.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       " \"For Immediate Release\\n\\nChicago, IL – November 4, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Chevron Corporation CVX, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Dow Inc. DOW, McDonald's Corporation MCD and The Home Depot Inc. HD.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\n5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as Dow Crosses Fresh Milestone\\n\\nWall Street is having an impressive bull run in 2021 with just eight weeks of trading left. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — recorded new all-time highs in each of the last three trading days. This has happened for the first time since December 2019.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on Nov 1, the Dow touched a key milestone of 36,000 for the first time. On Nov 2, the blue-chip index closed above 36,000 for the first time. The momentum is likely to continue in the near future as the market is likely to see a year-end rally buoyed by the upcoming holiday sales season, which is expected to beat expectations.\\n\\nEncouraging Dow Rally in 2021\\n\\nIn 2020, the Dow had gained 7.3% compared with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composites rallies of 16.3% and 43.6%, respectively. However, in 2021, market participants’ preferences have shifted from overvalued growth-oriented technology stocks to relatively undervalued cyclical stocks.\\n\\nAs the composition of the Dow leans toward cyclical stocks, the index gained momentum in 2021. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 17.8%, 23.3% and 21.4%, respectively.\\n\\nAt its current level of 36,052.63, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 34,945.59 and 33,836.45, respectively. The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIt is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.\\n\\nNear-Term Catalysts\\n\\nFirst, market valuation has already discounted the likelihood of the Fed starting to taper its monthly bond-buy program this year. The current projection by the CME FedWatch shows a 7% probability that the central bank will hike the benchmark interest rate in early 2022. The Fed has maintained that a rate hike is unlikely before the second half of 2022.\\n\\nSecond, on Nov 2, the initial estimation of the Atlanta Fed was that the U.S. economy will grow 8.1% in fourth-quarter 2021 after rising 2% in the third quarter. On Oct 29, the initial estimate for fourth-quarter GDP was 6.6%.\\n\\nThe U.S. GDP grew 6.4% and 6.7%, in the first and second quarter of this year, respectively. Moreover, robust U.S. corporate earnings in the first, second and third quarters bolstered market participants’ confidence in U.S. equities.\\n\\nThird, a strong reduction in the news cases of the Delta variant will pave the way for robust holiday sales. On Oct 28, the FDA approved the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for children of age 5 to 11. More than 28 million U.S. kids will now get the vaccine.\\n\\nHoliday retail sales are likely to climb this year as projected by various major market researchers like Deloitte, Mastercard SpendingPulse, Bain and KPMG. Notably, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP.\\n\\nFourth, on Oct 28, President Joe Biden announced that he reached a deal with Senate Democrats on the outlines of a $1.75 trillion social spending and climate bill. He appealed to House Democrats to vote for the stalled $1 trillion infrastructure bill that already passed the Senate.\\n\\nFifth, U.S. consumers have regained confidence in the economy. The Conference Board reported that the U.S. consumer confidence index climbed to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September, beating the consensus estimate of 107.5. The index rebounded after three consecutive months of decline.\\n\\nMore importantly, the expectations sub-index (consumers’ outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions for the next 6 months) improved to 91.3 in October from 86.7 in September.\\n\\nOur Top Picks\\n\\nWe have narrowed down our search to five Dow stocks with strong growth potential for the ensuing quarter. All these stocks witnessed robust earnings estimate revisions in the last 7 to 30 days, indicating solid business prospects. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see\\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\n\\nChevron is one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve a sustainable production ramp-up. Its existing project pipeline is one of the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\\n\\nChevron’s Noble Energy takeover has expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin.

Management is investing in several high-return growth projects including the expansion of downstream silicones capacity.\\n\\nThis Zacks Rank #1 company has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the quarter ending December 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings improved 12% over the last 30 days.\\n\\nMcDonald's has been making every effort to drive growth in the international markets.

We are constantly monitoring the potential regulatory risks to Facebook (and all of our holdings). At this point, we see very little chance that regulation changes Facebook’s business model in a meaningful and adverse way. Regarding the recent data shared by a former Facebook employee and the company itself on some of the unfortunate negative consequences of social media, we recognize these types of issues will inevitably linger in different forms and fashions well into the future. We have been focused on the ability of Facebook to identify and mitigate these negative consequences while amplifying the value users typically cite for its apps across a long list of use cases. We continuously monitor the vibrance of the user base on Facebook’s apps to confirm that value.”\\n\\n7. JD.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:JD) is a stock investors are interested in.\\n\\nIn the Q2 2021 investor letter of Arisaig Partners, the fund mentioned JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD). Here is what the fund had to say:\\n\\n“JD.com, for example, continues to display impressive operating momentum, with sales on track to grow around 30% this year by our estimates. Looking longer term, this company is making a credible claim to be the dominant player in Chinese grocery ecommerce, an enormous chunk of overall consumption in China, and the last one yet to move online in a big way. We think that JD has a clear advantage over rivals here thanks to its integrated and fully self-managed logistics capabilities. Whereas an offline big box retailer might have 10-20,000 SKUs, JD offers 8 million. 90% of orders fulfilled by JD Logistics can be delivered on the same day or the next day to 500 million customers. The fact that JD has just 30 days of inventory tells us that this is a highly-optimised fulfilment chain. It is very hard to be both fast and efficient, and in order to achieve this it is necessary to know what inventory to hold in which warehouse, and when to hold it (“right place, right time, right person”), a highly information-intensive challenge. The only other retailer that comes close to being able to manage that level of complexity is Amazon, and indeed these are capabilities that are very hard to replicate, taking decades of painstaking investment, trial and error testing, and data accumulation.\\n\\nMoreover, far from being some sort of ‘victim’, this company is most likely a beneficiary of tighter regulation in this sector. A recurrent message running through JD’s recent investor day was that of “deep purpose”, the objective being to create shared value for a broader ecosystem of customers, merchants and employees. As we describe in the next section on “Navigating China”, this form of alignment with the strategic objectives of the government is a very China-specific way of conceptualising ESG, and essential for all businesses that operate in this country to get right…” (Click here to see the full text)\\n\\n6.

Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Alphabet Inc. was among the top contributors to performance during the third quarter. Alphabet is a leading internet search provider and is a beneficiary in the share shift of advertising dollars from traditional mediums like television, radio and newspapers to digital platforms. The company is a leader in implementing Al, autonomous vehicles and cloud computing it and owns the highly trafficked YouTube property. Alphabet contributed to performance due to a strong quarterly report highlighted by revenue growth that beat consensus expectations across segments. The company’s core search revenues have increased 10% over the past two years, with cloud computing increasing 8%. Results from YouTube also exceeded expectations.

       " 'Below is a recap of the main news related to the cannabis industry and markets for the week of November 1st, 2021.\\n\\nContents\\n\\nCanopy’s Earnings Big Banks Vs. Cannabis New York’s Ban Of Delta-8 THC Products, Allowance Of Hemp Flower Sales Pakistan’s Commitment Philadelphia’s Decrim Markets M&A Financings Halloween Weekend Figures Microsoft Could Go Green Beverages International News B-Real Videogame Earnings Reports California And Oklahoma Top Stories Of The Week\\n\\nCanopy’s Earnings\\n\\nCanopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ: CGC), announced its financial results Friday for the second quarter fiscal 2022 ended September 30, revealing a 3% year-over-year decline in net revenue to CA$131 million ($105.4 million).\\n\\nTotal net cannabis revenue increased by 1% over the same period reaching CA$95 million in the second quarter of 2022.\\n\\nThe company also reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of CA$163 million for the same period, representing a CA$77 million wider loss versus the same period of last year, which can be attributed to lower sales, a decline in gross margins, partially offset by the reduction in total selling, general and administrative expenses.\\n\\nFollowing the announcement, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Pablo Zuanic reiterated a ‘Neutral’ rating and the same price target of $CA18.50 on Canopy’s stock, concerned by the revenue and adjusted EBITDA misses, the double-digit decline in domestic business-to-business cannabis sales and ongoing share loss.\\n\\nBenzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.\\n\\n“We rate the stock Neutral, but we realize it is a bellwether stock, in a momentum sector, more sensitive than most to news ﬂow about federal changes in US regulation. We believe CEO David Klein has the backing of Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) (he was a well-regarded CFO there) and the Canopy Growth Board of Directors, so we do not expect disruption to the strategic plan he is implementing,” Zuanic concluded.\\n\\nBig Banks Vs. Cannabis\\n\\nBanking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) may restrict the trading of certain U.S. cannabis-related stocks starting November 8.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAccording to Reuters, the company sent a letter to prime brokerage clients, citing compliance reasons: “J.P. Morgan (JPMS) has introduced a framework that is designed to comply with U.S. money laundering laws and regulations by restricting certain activities in the securities of U.S. Marijuana Related Businesses,\" the letter read.\\n\\nIt seems, however, the restriction will only apply to Over-The-Counter (OTC) traded stocks and limit new acquisitions and shorting of these equities. JPMorgan clients with pre-existing positions will be allowed to sell their shares at will.\\n\\nOther than these exceptions, JP Morgan noted, cannabis-related businesses that are fully compliant with federal U.S. law, and can thus be listed on the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange will continue to be permitted to trade. These are non-plant-touching businesses operating in the U.S. and elsewhere, as well as companies working with the cannabis plant in federally legal settings, such as Canada.\\n\\nSupport For Legalization\\n\\nThe number of Americans who think that marijuana should be legally obtainable hit a record high for the second year in a row, according to a new Gallup survey released Thursday, which showed that as many as 68% of U.S. residents support cannabis legalization. The figure is the same as last year, which is the highest percentage of support ever revealed in a national Gallup poll.\\n\\nMarijuana Research Bill For Veterans\\n\\nWith Veteran\\'s Day just around the corner, a House committee passed legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct clinical trials into the therapeutic potential of marijuana for military veterans.\\n\\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa (D-Cal), was approved by the House Veterans Affairs Committee on Thursday in an 18-11 vote, with all Democrats in support and all but one Republican opposed.\\n\\nThe earlier versions of the proposed legislation did not make it into law. Now, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act mandates that the department introduce a series of studies focusing on the use of medical marijuana in the treatment of PTSD and chronic pain.\\n\\nNew York’s Ban Of Delta-8 THC Products, Allowance Of Hemp Flower Sales\\n\\nThe New York Cannabis Control Board (CCB) made it clear on Wednesday – controversial delta-8 THC products cannot be sold, though hemp flower is allowed. The clarification comes some eight months after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the legalization bill into law.\\n\\nEmpire State regulators also approved the sale of hemp-infused food and beverages.\\n\\nPakistan’s Commitment\\n\\nIn the context of a meeting of the Standing Committee on Science and Technology of the National Assembly of Pakistan, Shibli Faraz, Minister of Science and Technology, pledged to file a bill for the national regulation of cannabis, before the end of 2021.\\n\\nPhiladelphia’s Decrim\\n\\nPhiladelphia voters approved a referendum on marijuana legalization. Preliminary results from Tuesday\\'s elections showed the proposal leading by a 73 percent to 27 percent margin.\\n\\nMarkets\\n\\nStocks posted mixed results this week. Over the five trading days of this week:\\n\\nThe ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): gained 2.2%. The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): rose 2.2%. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): advanced 3.7%. The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was down 0.2%. The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): advanced 1%.

In comparison, the National Retail Federation reported the average American spent about $30.40 on Halloween candy and $33.59 on costumes this year, totaling $63.99.\\n\\nHalloween weekend generated $182.7 million in total adult-use and medical cannabis sales, an 8.2% year-over-year growth, while Oct. 29 was the largest day in sales volume with $81.5 million. It was also the ninth-largest day for cannabis sales this year.\\n\\nMicrosoft Could Go Green\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) wants to build data centers and other buildings with materials such as hemp and algae.\\n\\nThe proposal seeks to displace concrete (a material that contributes to 8% of global CO2 emissions) with materials that store carbon.\\n\\nBeverages\\n\\nTwo Roots Beverage Co. will provide Truss Beverage Co., a joint venture between brewer Molson Coors Beverage Co.

(NEO: HALO) (OTCQB: HCANF) (Germany: A9KN) announced the completion of its previously-announced share purchase transaction with Akanda Corp. The transaction creates two stand-alone entities, Halo, which will continue to focus on the North American adult-use cannabis market, and Akanda, which will focus on medical cannabis for international markets, Kiran Sidhu, CEO of Halo, explained. Avicanna Inc. (TSX: AVCN) (OTCQX: AVCNF) (FSE: 0NN) announced that its Colombian subsidiary, Santa Marta Golden Hemp S.A.S., has met global conformity standards of Good Agricultural and Collection Practices for its 360,000 square foot cultivation project in Santa Marta. The certification allows the expansion of the company’s raw materials supply business to include organic, and now GACP certified dried flower and biomass at a global level. In a major regulatory win for the entire cannabis industry, the stringent Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) has approved a cannabis-derived CBD 50 mg/ml product produced by Verdemed Pharmaceuticals, in partnership with Colombian-American operator Clever Leaves Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CLVR). In addition to being able to commercialize the product, Verdemed will provide the medicine for a new clinical study on medicinal cannabis uses for long-haul COVID-19 sufferers, led by InCor, the Heart Institute of the São Paulo University Medical School (FMUSP).\\n\\nB-Real Videogame\\n\\nLEAF Mobile Inc. (TSX: LEAF) (OTCQB: LEMLF), a Canada-based free-to-play mobile game group, along with its subsidiary, LDRLY Games Inc., announced on Tuesday the worldwide launch of their next free-to-play mobile title, B-Real Monster Buds, released in collaboration with DGT Enterprise LLC.\\n\\nThe game is authentically represented by B-Real’s licensed music, style, voice and the 420 culture.\\n\\nCannabis Is America\\'s 5th Most Valuable Crop\\n\\nCannabis marketplace Leafly Holdings, Inc. released its inaugural Cannabis Harvest Report on Wednesday revealing that cannabis is America’s 5th most valuable crop. The report takes the first look at cannabis data, insights and projections across the 11 states where Americans can currently purchase both adult-use and medical cannabis.\\n\\nTo conduct the analysis, Leafly’s investigative team collaborated with Whitney Economics and ended up discovering that cannabis has become a major agricultural commodity that supports thousands of American farmers and farm communities.\\n\\nBased on the report, cannabis crops in adult-use states now support 13,042 licensed farms in the aggregate. On an annual basis, those farmers harvest 2,278 metric tons (5,022,990 pounds) of cannabis. To give you a better idea: that\\'s enough weed to roll more than two billion joints or fill 57 Olympic-size swimming pools.\\n\\nThat amount makes cannabis the fifth most valuable crop in the United States. With a wholesale harvest value of $6.2 billion, America’s cannabis harvest ranks above cotton and below wheat, based on US Department of Agriculture data for 2020. Only corn, soybeans, hay and wheat bring in more money to American farmers.\\n\\nBased on wholesale harvest value, this is how U.S. crops rate:\\n\\nCorn $61 billion Soybeans $46 billion Hay $17.3 billion Wheat $9.3 billion Cannabis $6.2 billion Cotton $4.7 billion Rice $3.1 billion Peanuts $1.3 billion\\n\\nEarnings Reports\\n\\nFind all the details on this week’s earnings reports on Benzinga Cannabis’ Earnings Center.

       " '(Bloomberg) -- A lot of the content on Facebook’s social-media services may be seen as being toxic, but that hasn’t stopped investors from pouring money back into the beaten-down stock.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nResults on Key Ballot Initiatives, From Policing to the Environment China’s Climate Goals Hinge on a $440 Billion Nuclear Buildout ‘Airbnb Queen’ Says She’s Caught Up in Platform’s New York Feud Where Did All the Public Bathrooms Go? Supply Chain Crisis Risks Taking the Global Economy Down With It\\n\\nShares of the social media giant, now known as Meta Platforms Inc., posted their first weekly gain since early September, before a trove of internal data from a whistle-blower unleashed another round of intense scrutiny that fueled a selloff. The stock rose 5.4% for the week, the most in more than three months. That would recoup almost half the stock’s decline from the past month.\\n\\nWhile investors acknowledge the services offered by Facebook and Instagram are flawed and the scrutiny the company faces isn’t going away anytime soon, many are still attracted to the business model and the profits it generates.\\n\\n“Investors are hip to the fact that consumers are going to use it and advertisers are going to pay them,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. “It’s printing money.”\\n\\nMeta is projected to generate nearly $40 billion in profit this year, up 37% from 2020, when customers cut back on digital advertising spending during the Covid-19 crisis. Trading at 23 times estimated profit, the stock is the cheapest among the five biggest U.S. technology companies by market value.\\n\\nRetail investors were also piling into the stock -- Meta was one of the five most-purchased by the retail crowd, according to data from Vanda Research on Wednesday.\\n\\nStill, challenges persist. The company’s projections for revenue in the current quarter fell short of expectations, it said last month, hindered in part by Apple Inc. curbs on collecting consumer data.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMeta is also being investigated by regulators from the U.S. to Europe. On Thursday, U.K. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries warned the company and its chiefs are on course for criminal prosecution for failing to rein in the harmful effects of its platform -- a week after the American Economic Liberties Project said it’s urging U.S. authorities to investigate whether top executives broke the law.\\n\\nFormer Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt also said Thursday the conduct revealed in the leaked documents is “pretty concerning” and Meta “knew what it was doing.”\\n\\nStill, Wall Street remains overwhelmingly supportive of the company and its recent strategy shift to new ventures, such as its focus on immersive digital experiences. More than 80% of the 62 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the company have buy ratings, and only three recommend selling.\\n\\nThe company is investing billions of dollars in Reality Labs, a business unit that includes its Oculus hardware division, as it aims to become the operating system of choice for augmented reality and virtual reality.\\n\\nJMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone said the investments are a call option on top of Meta’s ability to attract more advertisers due to “best-in-class” data on consumers.\\n\\n“The prize is clearly owning the next computer operating system, which has generated two $2 trillion companies,” he said in an interview, referring to Microsoft Corp. and Apple. “If I think about the cost of that call option, of it being $10 billion a year, I think the juice is worth the squeeze.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nAll Those 23andMe Spit Tests Were Part of a Bigger Plan Papa John Is Still Obsessed With Papa John’s The Power Grid Is Just Another Casino for Energy Traders The Amazon Is Fast Approaching a Point of No Return Big Teacher Is Watching: How AI Spyware Took Over Schools\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

A concept image of a white hollow candle stock chart displayed against a blue map of the Earth.\\n\\nSource: Who is Danny / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n5 Stocks Set to 10x Next Year\\n\\nEeek. I’m going to ask for a raise.\\n\\nThat’s because picking 10x winners is hard, no matter what “stock experts” claim. Of the 8,187 companies tracked by Thomson Reuters on the main U.S. exchanges, only eleven (or 0.1%) are 10x higher than they were in October 2020.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nOn top of that, most Moonshot stock pickers also go digging in the wrong places. They’re so focused on “finding the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)” they forget that most tech stocks are slow burners. Of the companies that went 10x in the past year, none were high-tech growth companies. The closest — Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) — is up only 7x from its IPO.\\n\\nInstead, these companies were a combination of:\\n\\nUnprofitable meme stocks. NASDAQ:OCGN, NASDAQ:MARA, NYSE:GME, NYSE:AMC, NASDAQ:AVIS Oil & gas firms. NYSE:SM, NASDAQ:CDEV, NYSE:UAN Near-bankrupt companies back from the dead. NYSEAMERICAN:ACY, NASDAQ:AEHR, OTCMKTS:HTZZ\\n\\nNot exactly your list of shining Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stars, are they?\\n\\nBut if you truly want to find stocks that go 10x in 12 months, this is the toxic sludge where we have to look. So, grab your snorkels. Today, we’ll consider what makes a 10x winner, and pick out five favorites that look set to rocket next year. An illustration of an astronaut wearing headphones sitting on a small planet with the text \"The Big Read\" next to them.\\n\\nSource: Catalyst Labs / Shutterstock\\n\\nWhat Makes a 10x Stock?\\n\\nLet’s make one thing clear: blue-chip Moonshot wagers are excellent bets — if you’re willing to stick around for a while. Anyone buying Amazon (AMZN) in 2001 would have waited a decade to cash in a 10x gain. Tesla managed to do it in three years, but its shares then flatlined for the next five.\\n\\n7 European Stocks to Buy to Diversify Your Portfolio\\n\\nBut today’s article is about getting rich quickly. And to do that, we’ll need to buy some ugly ducklings.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFinding Moonshots in Penny Stocks\\n\\nTo start, it helps to find some common factors that determine 10x winners. A chart showing the differences between 10x companies and average companies in share price, price-to-sales ratio, debt-to-equity percent and operating margin percent.\\n\\nIt turns out that these firms are cheaper, less profitable and more indebted than typical companies. And even after their stock prices rise, leverage and margins still remain poor.\\n\\nOTC stocks also tend to outperform. Of 4,779 companies listed over the counter, 506 (or 10.5%) managed returns of 1,000% or better. People are 100x more likely to find a big winner in the OTC markets than they are on the standard boards.\\n\\nThat’s why you’ll find me scouring alternate exchanges for great deals. In May, I recommended readers buy shares in bankrupt Hertz (OTCMKTS:HTZZ), explaining that it could become the top penny stock of 2021. Shares have since risen from $2.50 to over $30.\\n\\nToday, we’ll cover five more companies with the potential for 10x gains in 2022. An illustration of an astronaut tethered to a rocket.\\n\\nSource: Catalyst Labs / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n5 Stocks Set to 10x Next Year\\n\\nReddit investors love thematic investing. The success of GameStop (NYSE:GME) led to a mad rush into Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and other low-quality mall stocks. Meanwhile Dogecoin’s (CCC:DOGE-USD) rise created an entirely new asset class of pupcoins (A quick glance at BSCScan shows 22,101 different tokens named some iteration of “Shiba”).\\n\\nNow blockchain miner Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) could inspire the next generation of meme stocks: the cryptocurrency Moonshot.\\n\\nRocketFuel Blockchain (OTCMKTS:RKFL). This San Francisco-based OTC firm promises to bring 1-click crypto payment to ecommerce systems. POSaBIT (OTCMKTS:POSAF). The Canadian company is a leading provider of crypto payments to the cannabis industry.\\n\\nBoth of these potential meme stocks have reasonably experienced management teams backing them — RKFL is led by Peter Jensen, the former CEO of a cloud cybersecurity firm that was acquired by IBM (NYSE:IBM). And POSAF is run by former tech executives from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other blue-chip firms.\\n\\nThese two crypto Moonshots are also cheap — a requirement for stocks to go 10x quickly. POSAF trades at just $1.50, while RKFL is available for $0.50.\\n\\nThe main reason to buy however, is that both firms operate in a red hot industry. Reddit users have pumped crypto stocks like SOS Limited (NYSE:SOS) and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) before, and they’re almost guaranteed to do it again.\\n\\nThere are certainly risks. RocketFuel’s former CEO seems to have vanished from the corporate website without a trace, while POSaBIT could run into competition from Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and point-of-sale (POS) companies.\\n\\nNo one ever claimed these firms were high quality. But as far as meme stocks go, these two Moonshot picks have all the ingredients for a 10x rise.\\n\\nLabor Firms are the Next Oil & Gas\\n\\nEcofriendly investors probably wish they could forget 2021, a year where fossil fuel companies trounced renewable energy ones. It’s hard to lose when prices for your only product go from negative $37 to $85 per barrel.\\n\\nAs we move into 2022 though, a totally different industry should see similar growth: staffing service firms.\\n\\nThat’s because these firms are much like oil & gas companies — low margin, heavily commoditized and dependent on market cycles. Volt Information Science (NYSEAMERICAN:VOLT) traded as high as $44 during the 1997 tech bubble and $40 during the 2006 housing bubble before crashing down to under $4 today. A chart showing the performance of VOLT stock from 1990 to 2020, showing that it spiked during tight labor markets.\\n\\nFirst published in the Oct. 4 issue of the Moonshot Investor\\n\\nTwo cheap stocks now look even better positioned than VOLT to go 10x as labor markets tighten.\\n\\nGee Group (NYSEAMERICAN:JOB). The century-old company specializes in professional staffing, including IT, engineering and medical services Team Inc (NYSE:TISI). This engineering outsourcing company provides inspection and other services to various industries including energy, manufacturing and infrastructure.\\n\\nMuch like oil & gas in 2020, these two staffing firms are currently deep in the red. Operating margins are negative, and their Altman-Z scores (a measure of solvency) both sit below the standard 2.4 threshold of healthy firms.\\n\\nBut we’re not here for quality or high-tech. We’re here for 10x gains.\\n\\nAs Covid-19 unemployment benefits are pared back, many will find themselves pushed back into the job market. And much like oil & gas companies last year, staffing firms will see their bottom lines flip positive as both supply and demand pick back up. Wall Street analysts are already predicting break-even margins in 2021 for Gee Group, and positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization) in 2022 for Team Inc.\\n\\nThe Next Bankrupt Hertz: NGL Energy Partners (NGL)\\n\\nAttempting to pick out the next bankrupt Moonshot is risky at best. For every Hertz that goes 10x, several dozen more go straight to zero. Most bankruptcies — from Intelsat (OTCMKTS:INTEQ) and Sequential Brands (OTCMKTS:SQBG) — simply don’t have enough hidden equity value to pay off bondholders.\\n\\nBut NGL Energy Partners is different. This natural gas pipeline only had customers who were in bankruptcy.\\n\\nAnd that’s a world of difference.\\n\\nNGL Energy Partners is a natural gas master limited partnership (MLP) that markets have priced to fail. The stock trades at an absurd 1x price-to-cashflow (P/CF), a tenth of typical gas pipeline companies. Much of these woes stem from sagging customer demand, especially following the 2021 Texas energy crisis.\\n\\nNatural gas bears however, are in for a surprise this winter. Last month, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) raised its price target for Henry Hub natural gas to $5.80, over twice the price of 2020 levels. And with many energy firms looking to ramp production to fill demand, pipelines like NGL could switch from money-losing to money-printing in a matter of months.\\n\\nThe Perils of 10x Investing\\n\\nWhen I named Hertz as a top penny stock, I did so with full knowledge of how American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock acted back in 2011. Bankrupt companies can rise from the dead if they have enough hidden asset value to cover their debts.\\n\\nBut these companies tend to exist on a knife’s edge. If a firm has $15 billion in debt, equity holders will only get paid if gross asset values exceed that figure.\\n\\nAnd that brings us to Intelsat, a defunct satellite company trading at $0.021.\\n\\nAt first glance, Intelsat looks a lot like Hertz did in 2020 — swaddled in crushing debt and owned by bondholders willing to take a 50% haircut (doing so would mean equity holders get nothing).\\n\\nBut unlike Hertz, sitting on a vast fleet of fairly-new rental cars, Intelsat owns an aging set of satellites that need replacing. More than half of the firm’s satellites are more than a decade old, and it’s unlikely an Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will swoop in with a $15+ billion offer.\\n\\nIt’s no surprise that shares have dropped 96% so far this year, and that I’m still warning investors to stay away.\\n\\nP.S.

       " \"Yahoo Finance Editor-In-Chief Andy Serwer is in Lisbon, Portugal for the 2021 Web Summit. There he sat down with Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith to discuss the future of work.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\n- Well, now we have Yahoo Finance's Editor in Chief, Andy Serwer. He is in Lisbon, Portugal for the 2021 Web Summit. And he just sat down with Microsoft President and Vice Chair, Brad Smith to discuss the future of work. Let's take a listen.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: I think everything is being rethought. I mean, when we think about a product like Teams, you know, the interesting thing about Teams, just to offer a broader sort of almost social perspective as distinct from making a product pitch, is that we designed it really frankly both to compete with a product like Zoom and a product like Slack. So in other words, it was designed to integrate together the video interaction, and all of the new ways that people want to collaborate both synchronously and asynchronously.\\n\\nAnd when you just step back and think about that, I think it sort of captures that people really want to work in a variety of different ways, with a variety of different people, in a number of different teams, and not in a single organizational box.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.57%, or 204 points and hit an intraday record of 36,328.31. The Nasdaq added 0.2% to end at a record of 15,971.59.

But when it comes to QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) stock, conditions are looking positively charged for big-time profits. A QuantumScape sign at the company's headquarters.\\n\\nSource: Michael Vi/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWith that in mind, let’s explore a bit of what’s happening off and on the price chart of QS stock. Then, we will offer a risk-adjusted determination aligned with those findings.\\n\\nJust this week, a decision from the Fed to taper its longstanding commitment in the bond market has been a major story. And this news has provided fuel for a handful of stocks in return.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nNot that anyone is paying any mind or can be found quickly giving reasons as to why the move is a positive for stocks. Yet, in the scheme of things those developments, good or bad, have little to do with QS stock.\\n\\nSince going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with Kensington Capital less than a year ago, QuantumScape has been largely detached from broader stock averages sporting double-digit gains and hitting record highs in 2021. And this applies to both positive and negative moves for QS stock.\\n\\n7 European Stocks to Buy to Diversify Your Portfolio\\n\\nFrom a rapid stock ascent in the fourth quarter of 2020, to this year’s implosion that saw QS stock shed 80% from its peak share price of $132.73 by mid-August, make no mistake this isn’t a well-correlated stock like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Home Depot (NYSE:HD).\\n\\nThe other thing is this: QuamtumScape is a pre-sales and untested concept-stage venture aiming to jumpstart electric vehicles’ (EVs) still-apparent battery shortcomings with next-gen multilayer, solid state technology.\\n\\nIf it pans out, expect a multi-bagger opportunity to unfold. However, QS stock is not for those that wait for traditional metrics to play out.\\n\\nQuantumScape’s sales black hole is going to remain a reality for QS stock investors for the foreseeable future. The outfit doesn’t expect a working battery for deployment into partner Volkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) EVs before 2024 and maybe not until 2025.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe good news, though? QuantumScape’s obvious request from shareholders to have patience isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The stock market is about future expectations and pricing shares with forward-looking efficiency, right?\\n\\nAnd by the time QuantumScape looks even remotely close to making good on rolling out real world batteries, the current share price near $30.60 is likely to look like a gift.\\n\\nThere’s no guarantees of course. But so far, so good.\\n\\nIn fact, last week, QuantumScape received third-party proof of its own successful single layer testing made public this past December. And rightfully, it stung QS stock’s 15% short interest to the tune of nearly 14% in the report’s aftermath.\\n\\nThere’s more to be upbeat regarding QuantumScape’s chances going forward, too.\\n\\nAdditionally, as InvestorPlace’s Faizan Farooque smartly noted, QS stock also has roughly $1.5 billion in cash on hand to continue improving on that technology without raising capital and ultimately achieving road-ready batteries critical to further greening the planet.\\n\\nQS Stock Weekly Price Chart QuantumScape (QS) weekly Bollinger and congestion breakout with favorable bullish stochastics crossover in play\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Charts by TradingView\\n\\nOverall, the illustrated weekly QS stock chart is largely in agreement that the road going forward looks increasingly for investors to buy shares.\\n\\nWith this past week’s favorable news and bullish reaction, shares of QuantumScape have staged a pinched Bollinger Band and tight congestion pattern breakout.\\n\\nMoreover, secondary confirmation from a stochastics crossover is also acting as a support for higher prices and an emerging bullish cycle for QS stock.\\n\\nOptimistically, a double or even a triple in price in the next 12 to 18 months isn’t out of the question given the size of QS stock’s correction this year.\\n\\nTo be fair, even if our outlook proves more accurate than not, QuantumScape’s reputation for significant volatility and possibility for more challenging counter swings in shares shouldn’t be ignored. In fact, they should be embraced!\\n\\nOverall, and as I’ll continue to recommend to bullish investors, QuantumScape’s heady zigs and zags in stock price should be exploited using an actively-traded longer-term collar strategy on shares. One favored, fully-hedged vehicle of this type of spread is the December $25/$35 collar.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But he acknowledged that their success owes to a working class of millions who made it possible for them to flourish.\\n\\n\"I have always thought that the capitalist system should reward people for coming up with ideas and products that make other people\\'s lives safer, healthier, more fun, more productive,\" he says. \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n\"Having said that, do I also think that those people when they succeed — when a Bill Gates succeeds, did he create Microsoft?

The tax rate for the wealthiest families over that period fell below the average 13.3% tax rate paid by US families in 2018, the Tax Foundation found.\\n\\nTo be sure, many of the wealthiest Americans give away large sums to charity. Bill and Melinda Gates have given nearly $37 billion to the Gates Foundation, a philanthropic organization that fights poverty and disease across the globe. At the COP26 climate summit this week, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledged $2 billion for restoring natural habitats and addressing flaws in the food system.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with a rise in average CEO compensation as well as an explosion in income among the nation\\'s top-earning CEOs and its wealthiest individuals.\\n\\nEight of the highest-earning executives each received compensation last year worth more than $100 million. In 2019, only one executive reached that threshold, according to a survey conducted by consulting firm Equilar for The New York Times.\\n\\nMoreover, the richest 1% of Americans own roughly 16 times more wealth than the bottom 50%, Federal Reserve data for the first quarter of 2021 showed.\\n\\nThe fortune of U.S. billionaires has grown $2.1 trillion during the pandemic, boosting their collective wealth by 70%, according to the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies.

EA.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\n4 Stocks to Watch in a Booming Videogame Industry\\n\\nThe craze for videogames that peaked following the coronavirus outbreak last year hasn’t died out. This is contrary to the predictions of many that sales would decline once the economy reopens and people start going outdoors for entertainment.\\n\\nThis has seen sales jumping every month even this year, barring April when sales surprisingly took a hit.\\n\\nVideogame Sales Continue to Soar\\n\\nAccording to a new report from NDP Group, spending on videogame hardware, content and accessories hit a record $4.4 billion in September, reflecting a 3% year-over-year jump. The maximum spending was on hardware, with sales surging 49% year over year to $412 million.\\n\\nOn a year-to-date basis, spending on hardware, content and accessories reached $42.3 billion, marking a 12% increase year over year. For hardware, spending reached $3.4 billion, jumping 12% year over year.\\n\\nThis once again shows the underlying strength in the industry and how the gaming craze has only continued to grow over the years.\\n\\nThe gaming industry was already doing great and the pandemic worked miracles, as sales soared given that people spent billions last year. Spending on content also increased 10% on a year-to-date basis to $37.1 billion.\\n\\nFuture Holds Promise\\n\\nIn September,\\xa0Sony and Nintendo continued to dominate the hardware segment. Sony’s PlayStation 5was the best-selling hardware platform both in terms of dollar sales and units. It was also the best-selling hardware platform in terms of dollar sales on a year-to-date basis, while Nintendo’s Switch was the bestseller in terms of units.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMobile spending on games surpassed $2 billion in eight of the first nine months of 2021. Not many had thought that the videogame industry would hold onto the momentum it got last year.\\n\\nAs the economy reopened and people started getting vaccinated, outdoor entertainment joints once again started attracting footfall. That was expected to unsettle sales of videogames somewhat but that didn’t happen. September’s jump is the fifth straight month of increase and the picture is likely to remain rosy\\xa0 in the coming days too.\\n\\nAlso, last year saw the release of some big and attractive titles alongside the launch of new consoles. NPD Group’s Q2 2021 Games Market Dynamics: U.S. shows that spending on videogames in the second quarter of 2021 increased 2% year over year to reach $14 billion. The third quarter too is expected to be equally good given that sales jumped in each of the months.\\n\\nStocks to Watch\\n\\nThe videogame industry was already thriving and is booming this year too. Given this scenario, it would thus be ideal to invest in these stocks.\\n\\nMicrosoft is one of the leading videogame makers and manufacturers of hardware and accessories. The company has been expanding its footprint in the industry and recently announced that it will be acquiring videogame maker ZeniMax Media.\\n\\nThe company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 15.2%.

Software runs today’s world. Microsoft makes the operating system and tool set people rely on most. Thus, Microsoft runs the world. It’s not complicated.\\n\\n7 European Stocks to Buy to Diversify Your Portfolio\\n\\nBut this didn’t seem obvious when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014. It still doesn’t seem obvious to those who confuse companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) with clouds.\\n\\nThe difference is this. Netflix and Twitter rent cloud capacity, so as they grow their costs rise. Microsoft is buying and building capacity, so while its costs grow revenues also rise, including revenue from renting that capacity. It’s the difference between being a landlord and a tenant.\\n\\nThe Practical Metaverse\\n\\nMSFT stock also runs rings around rivals from a strategic perspective.\\n\\nTake the metaverse, which makes William Gibson’s concept of cyberspace real, people seeming to interact within a computer system. The artists formerly known as Facebook were laughed at when they announced this, changing the company name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) and turning the CEO into a cartoon.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMicrosoft is doing the same thing, only quietly, step by step, and in a businesslike manner. It’s working with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose fast graphics chips make things like the metaverse possible.\\n\\nIt’s putting this capability into its Teams product, emphasizing collaboration and communication. The idea is to make working from home feel like working together in a physical office. By solving the work from home dilemma, on software already used by 250 million people, Microsoft will get metaverse technology into the mainstream as fast as it can be rolled out.\\n\\nThe Paid Cloud\\n\\nThis illustrates a second difference between Microsoft and the other cloud companies.\\n\\nThe Microsoft cloud is a paid cloud. It supports open source software, which is downloaded free. But the open source contract also requires improvements be donated back. Microsoft’s customers are also developers, growing its software stack.\\n\\nEverything else, you pay for. It’s worth the price, but you pay. By contrast, Meta (and to a great extent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) consists mainly of free services. Apple, meanwhile, gets most of its money from selling devices, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) from selling physical products.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on MSFT Stock\\n\\nThe only force that can slow MSFT stock right now is government. But it’s not in government’s self-interest to do so.\\n\\nThat’s because Microsoft’s software makes government more efficient. The percentage of government income, at every level, going into bureaucracy keeps falling. Going after Microsoft on antitrust grounds, as the U.S. did two decades ago, would put further gains at risk.\\n\\nBesides, Microsoft’s cloud is essential to competition. Other large software firms like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) depend upon it. This is a global dependence, not a national one.\\n\\nIt’s Microsoft’s world now. We just live in it.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in AMZN, AAPL, NVDA, and MSFT.

       " \"Billionaire Tom Steyer joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to share his thoughts on capitalism and America's wealth gap.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nANDY SERWER: You're a billionaire who supports a wealth tax. There are some people who say billionaires shouldn't exist. What do you say to those people?\\n\\nTOM STEYER: Look, I have always thought that the capitalist system is going to and should reward people for coming up with ideas and products that make other people's lives safer, healthier, more fun, more productive. Absolutely. Does that bother me? Absolutely not. Having said that, do I also think that those people, when they succeed, when a Bill Gates succeeds, did he create Microsoft? Yeah, at some level, he did, but he did it within a system that other people, millions of poor people, millions of unassuming people had dedicated their lives to create.\\n\\nSo he was building-- you know the old saying, standing on the shoulders of giants? Everyone who creates a company in the United States is standing on the shoulders of giants. They are part of a system that had enabled them. And the idea that their success is theirs alone and is not shared with their fellow citizens makes no sense to me. It seems to me to be absolutely missing the point of America.\\n\\nSo do I have problems with the idea of a wealth tax, where this society has gotten so out of whack in terms of the inequities of wealth? No, that does-- I'm totally for that. I'm totally fine. I think, you know, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Melinda Gates started something about giving away at least half your wealth while you're alive on the assumption that you recognize that you are part of society.\\n\\nYou have huge obligations, responsibilities, and debts to your fellow citizens who have done so much. That teacher, that soldier, that nurse, who've done so much to create a system that is safe for you to go write some code and make a ton of money. So let's just be clear, we're in this together. Nobody is going to succeed in the United States of America without everybody else succeeding as far as I'm concerned.\",\n",

       " 'Over the past few years, the idea of 100-baggers has gotten popular. This is an amazing concept; making a 100-times return on your investment. Put another way, if you have $10,000 and get a 100-bagger, you’ll end up with a million dollars. What sorts of superstocks are capable of becoming 100-baggers?\\n\\nIn general, they start out fairly small, come up with some innovative product or greatly reshape/improve their industry. Another type of superstocks are the companies led by star management teams that are capable of deploying capital shrewdly, constantly making perfect mergers and acquisitions (M&As) deals.\\n\\nThe list below includes companies of both kinds. And, when calculating total returns, don’t forget the dividends. The calculations below include reinvested dividends over the years — which in many cases end up being a huge portion of one’s total investment gains.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\n10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy After Winning in Q3\\n\\nOne other important thing about superstocks: They’re not just tech companies either. As you’ll see, they can include more staid industries such as beverages, railroads and even banks. So now, let’s meet seven superstocks that generated at least 10,000% returns — 100-baggers — over the past 30 years:\\n\\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Glacier Bancorp (NASDAQ:GBCI)\\n\\nSuperstocks : Monster Beverage (MNST) A can of Monster Beverage (MNST) energy drinks sits on top of a skateboard.\\n\\nSource: Domagoj Kovacic / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $32,250,000\\n\\nMonster Beverage is the best-performing U.S. stock of the 2000s and quite possibly back to 1991 as well. The energy drink maker might seem like an extremely random company to end up being an all-time great investment.\\n\\nHowever, it had several factors that gave it that honor. For one, it started off the 1990s with a microscopic market cap. It wasn’t until 2004 that the firm’s market cap topped $100 million. The firm is now worth $48 billion. However, if it had started off at a $5 billion initial public offering (IPO) — as is common for many hot companies today — investors would have only earned 10x instead of thousands of times return on their capital.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSo that’s the first thing: When you’re shooting for the stars, try to buy some firms with a small enough market cap to have room to really grow.\\n\\nFor another, Monster is a fundamentally attractive business. It puts sugar, water and caffeine in a can and charges a huge profit margin for it. That’s the same classic tale as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which also made a ton of people into millionaires. Monster’s unique edge was its superior branding and management’s unrelenting drive to keep growing the business. The investors that had the foresight to own MNST stock the whole way up have now earned returns beyond anyone’s wildest dreams.\\n\\nKansas City Southern (KSU) A Kansas City Southern de Mexico (KSU) train parked on the tracks in Forth Worth, Texas.\\n\\nSource: Paul Brady Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $13,660,000\\n\\nLike Monster, Kansas City Southern is probably another surprise. What’s a railroad doing on the list of the top-performing stocks of the past 30 years?\\n\\nGo back in time, however, and railroads were a dying industry. Passenger rail essentially collapsed in the mid-1900s with the advent of cheap cars and interstate travel. Meanwhile, freight was disadvantaged as the combination of long-distance truckers and air freight took away a lot of marginal business from rails. Throw in labor problems, bad balance sheets and headstrong management teams, and rail was viewed as a dead industry.\\n\\nThen a series of reforms and modernizations occurred and rail regained the cost advantage against trucking. Rail volumes surged while overhead declined. Throw in a series of mergers to reduce competition and profits soared. Kansas City Southern was the biggest beneficiary of this, with its shares rising hundreds of times over.\\n\\n7 European Stocks to Buy to Diversify Your Portfolio\\n\\nThe fun isn’t quite over yet. A private equity firm tried to acquired Kansas City Southern last year. It escalated into a bidding war but ultimately KSU shot it all down and remained independent. All this excitement led to a 70% run in the stock over the past year, and a 275% move over the past five years. Don’t let anyone tell you there isn’t money in “boring” industries. KSU stock is a striking counterexample to that notion.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) White Apple (AAPL) logo on glass with people in background\\n\\nSource: ZorroGabriel / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $8,543,000\\n\\nApple is the classic example of a buy-and-hold investment that worked out magically. The company has created life-changing wealth for investors.\\n\\nIt wasn’t always a sure thing, though. Indeed, Apple trailed the likes of Monster and Kansas City Southern because the 1990s was a wasted decade for the firm. It accomplished little and was in danger of bankruptcy at one point given the struggles of the Mac computer at the end of that decade. Even with huge long-term winners, there will still be crises of faith along the way.\\n\\nFor investors that held the line, however, they were richly rewarded once the iPod launched in 2001. That started Apple’s modern revival and then the iPhone went on and changed everything later that decade. The Apple of today has struggled to find the same growth opportunities it did ten or fifteen years ago, but it can now reward investors with dividends and big share buybacks instead.\\n\\nRoper Technologies (ROP) Image of Roper Technologies logo visible on display screen\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $2,868,000\\n\\nThis one is probably a surprise to most readers. Roper Technologies isn’t even a household name yet. However the firm has been extraordinarily successful over the past 30 years. What accounts for that success?\\n\\nBack in the early 1990s, Roper was a pretty humble, small, unexciting industrial business. It manufactured a variety of basic goods for industrial uses. However, it started to transform its business by making a series of acquisitions in more fast-moving areas. By the early 2000s, it started becoming a software conglomerate, buying up tech businesses serving non-glamorous uses left and right.\\n\\n7 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks That Should Grace Your Portfolio\\n\\nThe Roper of today now has software for everything from power plant management to 3D graphics and animation, insurance brokers and supply chain management among many others. Roper is ruthless about managing its cash flow, only putting funds into businesses with strong growth opportunities while selling off assets that don’t keep up. The firm’s constant capital recycling, aggressive use of dealmaking and leverage has allowed it to rack up a stunning 28,000% return over the past 30 years.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.\\n\\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $2,736,000\\n\\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that the king of office software made this list. Microsoft has been a standout performer through multiple tech booms now.\\n\\nWhat might come as a surprise is that the company had to make a big pivot. It actually wouldn’t have hit the 10,000% return threshold if it wasn’t for its cloud computing division. Indeed between 2000 and 2015, despite sharply rising profits, MSFT stock went absolutely nowhere. Investors weren’t willing to pay a big P/E ratio anymore for what was considered a staid, no-growth software business.\\n\\nHowever, unleashing the Azure cloud division changed everything. Once again, Microsoft became a real growth company and its P/E ratio went from around 12 back up to 30. Throw in multiple expansion on rapid earnings growth and a healthy dividend over the years, and you have the makings of a 100-bagger stock.\\n\\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments (TXN) logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\\n\\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $1,537,000\\n\\nA big problem with investing in tech companies is picking winners from losers. For every Apple or Microsoft, there’s a dozen Palms, Blackberrys (NYSE:BB), and Lucents that looked like home run stocks for awhile but ended up being losers. So how to avoid that?\\n\\nInstead of having the hot consumer product, instead, sell components that go into that products. Aside from Texas Instruments’ calculators, it has very few products of its own to sell to the public. Rather, it makes the chips that go into all sorts of modern electronic devices. Be it cars, mini-computers, appliances, Internet of Things devices and so on, it probably has Texas Instruments chips inside it.\\n\\n7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for Q4 Earnings Season\\n\\nThe company’s platform-agnostic model has allowed it to thrive despite rapid technological change. The firm competes in more slow-moving markets rather than fighting to be the supplier for iPhones, for example. This allows the company to generate more return on its investments in R&D. Texas Instruments is also a skilled capital allocator, mixing share buybacks and acquisitions with great skill. Add it all up, and it’s amounted to a more than 15,000% return over the past 30 years.\\n\\nGlacier Bancorp (GBCI) bank stocks A customer makes a transaction at a bank\\n\\nSource: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\n$10,000 Invested In 1991 Is Now Worth: $1,130,000\\n\\nFinally, we round out the list with a humble bank out of the Pacific Northwest. Hailing from Kalispell, Montana, Glacier has assembled a regional banking empire spanning many cities and towns across the Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nWhat has made Glacier a more than 100-bagger over the years? The company earns extremely high returns on equity, and it engages in a ton of mergers and acquisitions. Because Glacier historically has performed well, people pay a premium for its stock. That premium, in turn, serves as currency for Glacier. It can issue its own high-priced shares, buy up a cheaper bank and add to its geographic reach.\\n\\nBanks have tons of redundant costs in management, software and services, compliance costs, and the like. So just merging two banks together saves money in general, and Glacier’s particularly top-notch team wrings out more cost benefits. The Rockies tend to be less competitive than other markets as well due to the sparse population, giving Glacier another strategic edge. The banks serves as a good reminder that you don’t have to be a technology company to generate life-changing returns.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ROP, GBCI and TXN stock.

       " \"Google CEO Sundar Pichai delivers the keynote address of the Google I/O conference, Wednesday, May 17, 2017, in Mountain View, Calif. Google provided the latest peek at the digital services and gadgets that it has assembled in the high-tech tussle to become an even more influential force in people's lives. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\\n\\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) briefly hit a market capitalization of $2 trillion on Monday, less than two years after hitting the $1 trillion mark in January 2020. Its stock price retreated back below $2 trillion shortly after topping the number.\\n\\nAlphabet joins the ranks of tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which are the only other publicly traded U.S. companies to cross the mark. Alphabet’s growth has been powered by its dominance of the online advertising industry, which has long functioned as a de facto duopoly between Google and Facebook.\\n\\nAccording to a May 2021 report by eMarketer, Google collected 27.5% of net global ad revenue in 2020, while Facebook collected 22.3%. E-commerce giants Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN), however, are slowly catching up, with the former seeing 8.6% of global net ad revenue and the latter seeing 5.2%.\\n\\nAlphabet became such a dominant force in online advertising thanks, in part to the ubiquity of its online search capabilities. After all, “Googling” became the default stand-in for performing an online search years ago.\\n\\nIt’s not just its search engine that drove Alphabet to such heights. Its acquisition of the Android operating system in 2005 for a mere $50 million was a prescient move ahead of the launch of Apple’s first iPhone in 2007.\\n\\nOffering the software as an open source operating system ensured that Android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat allowed the company to funnel ever more user data into its advertising business, further beefing up its advertising efficiency.\\n\\nA year after snapping up Android, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion. The world’s largest video sharing site, YouTube has been a boon for Alphabet, enabling further advertising opportunities beyond Android and its search and mail businesses.\\n\\nYouTube, however, has brought its share of controversy. The site has been frequently lambasted for allowing wild conspiracy theories and disinformation to propagate across the platform.\\n\\nAlphabet has also jumped into the public cloud arena, with its Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A rival to Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, GCP captured just 6.1% of global market share in 2020 compared to Amazon’s 40.8% and Microsoft’s 19.7%, according to research firm Gartner. But Google’s share has grown from 5.2% in 2019, while Amazon’s fell from 44.6%.\\n\\nMore recently, Alphabet has found itself in the crosshairs of federal and state investigators, facing a whopping four antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. The European Union’s antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, has also taken aim at Alphabet, fining the company billions of dollars for antitrust violations.\\n\\nDespite such headwinds, Alphabet’s stock price continues to rise, making it one of the most valuable companies on Earth by market capitalization.\\n\\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\\n\\nMore from Dan\\n\\nApple SharePlay: How to watch movies and TV shows with up to 33 people at once Facebook's metaverse will still track your every move Activision Blizzard earnings beat expectations on bottom line, but miss on Q4 outlook\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\\n\\nGot a tip?

Total subscribers exceeded 200 million, up 22% over the previous year. However, in the first half of 2021, new subscriber additions slowed substantially, totaling only 5.5 million due to slower new content additions impacted by production delays, a resumption of outdoor activity as people everywhere adjusted to living with COVID, and the impact of a “pull-forward effect” on subscriber growth in last year’s very strong results.

Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n\"Wells Fargo (Long +16%) was the strongest contributor to portfolio performance over the quarter. Wells Fargo shares rallied given a better outlook for bad debts driven by improving employment and house price trends. The company had been very undervalued due to excessive fears around likely bad debts due to the pandemic, the continued regulatory “asset cap” (a punishment that was put in place in 2017 for numerous compliance failures) and an inability to commence buybacks. The share price has subsequently recovered strongly in recent months as the company has progressed its turnaround program under the leadership of the well-regarded CEO, Charles Scharf (former CEO of Visa and BNY Mellon). Wells Fargo is now closer to getting the asset cap lifted and has announced a huge cost out program (US$8b+) as well as an $18b buyback program to be completed over the next 12 months. Wells Fargo shares have rallied more than 50% since we initiated the position in late 2020. Given the strong rally, we elected to exit our position and rotate into stocks with larger valuation upside.\"\\n\\n6.

We used Tweksbury\\'s 13F portfolio for Q2 2021 for this analysis.\\n\\nLarge-Cap Stocks to Buy According to Matthew Tewksbury\\'s Stevens Capital\\n\\n10. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)\\n\\nStevens Capital Stake Value: $5,623,000\\n\\nPercentage of Stevens Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 1.64%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\\n\\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a specialty coffee roaster, marketer, and retailer worldwide. Analysts are bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). On October 11, BofA analyst Sara Senatore restored coverage on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). She rated the stock as \"Buy\" and gave a price target of $135.\\n\\nMatthew Tewksbury\\'s Stevens Capital currently holds 50,288 shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) that amount to $5.62 million.\\n\\nPolen Capital, an investment management firm, in its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“For Starbucks, we believe the underlying businesses for the company remain strong. Starbucks has grappled with the impact of the pandemic, but results have continued to show an ongoing post-pandemic recovery.”\\n\\n9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\\n\\nStevens Capital Stake Value: $6,951,000\\n\\nPercentage of Stevens Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 2.03%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\\n\\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) runs retail, wholesale, and other businesses worldwide. Walmart was added to Goldman Sachs\\' Conviction List on October 18, and analyst Kate McShane reiterated a “Buy” rating on the stock and increased her price target to $196, up from $184.\\n\\nAccording to the latest data, Stevens Capital owned 28,999 shares of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) worth more than $10.08 million in the second quarter of 2021, representing 2.95% of the fund\\'s holdings data.\\n\\nClearBridge Investments, in its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart and Costco has been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”\\n\\n8. Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)\\n\\nStevens Capital Stake Value: $10,083,000\\n\\nPercentage of Stevens Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 2.95%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 266\\n\\nFacebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) controls three of the world\\'s six most popular social media platforms: WhatsApp, Instagram, and, of course, Facebook itself, with 2.9 billion monthly active users. Matthew Tewksbury\\'s Stevens Capital currently owns 28,999 shares of Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) worth $10.08 million. Facebook occupies 2.95% of the hedge fund’s overall equity.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 266 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $42.35 billion in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), up from 257 the preceding quarter worth $40.97 billion.\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), are some of the large-cap stocks to buy according to Matthew Tewksbury\\'s Stevens Capital, along with Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).\\n\\nIn its third-quarter 2021 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners mentioned Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n\"Facebook detracted from performance despite posting a staggering +56% growth in advertising revenues. Much of the stock\\'s underperformance was driven by nonoperating concerns that we view as mostly political in nature. The company\\'s digital properties command a massive audience of over 2.7 billion daily users, so any government or state actor would be able to wield tremendous power by controlling that audience and it should not be a surprise when those actors attempt to do that. However, Facebook has invested aggressively in its content curation capabilities that address many of the concerns raised by media and political critics. We continue to carry Facebook at our maximum weighting as the stock is trading in line with a market multiple despite unrivaled competitive positioning and rapid growth, representing one of the best risk-rewards available in the market.\"\\n\\n7. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\\n\\nStevens Capital Stake Value: $10,407,000\\n\\nPercentage of Stevens Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 3.04%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 143\\n\\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), a technology platform and digital payments corporation, ranks seventh on the list of 10 large-cap stocks to buy according to Matthew Tewksbury\\'s Stevens Capital. Clients of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) have access to a wider choice of digital banking tools. PayPal said in September that it is working on a new integrated app with high-yield savings, in-app purchasing possibilities with cashback incentives, early access direct deposit, and bill pay.\\n\\nAccording to 13F filings, Stevens Capital owned 35,705 shares in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) worth over $10.41 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021, representing 3.04% of the portfolio of the fund.\\n\\nOut of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Locust Wood Capital Advisers is a leading shareholder in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) with 146,178 shares worth more than $38.04 million.\\n\\nPolen Capital, an investment management firm, in its third-quarter 2021 investor letter, mentioned PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Despite reporting solid earnings results, PayPal moved lower during the quarter. We believe the decline was primarily due to the company reporting near-term growth headwinds from the remainder of its eBay payment volumes, which have declined faster than expected. Our expectations included PayPal’s payment volumes from eBay declining rapidly, and much more importantly in our view, the fast-paced growth of the rest of PayPal’s payment volumes. This growth has been due to the increased adoption of its digital wallets (PayPal and Venmo) and checkout buttons. The shift to digital payments and e-commerce are significant tailwinds for PayPal. The pandemic further catalyzed these tailwinds, and we believe the move to digital payments is here to stay.”\\n\\n6. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\\n\\nStevens Capital Stake Value: $11,598,000\\n\\nPercentage of Stevens Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 3.39%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 113\\n\\nNetflix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX), worth $13.22 billion, compared to 110 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total value of approximately $14.16 billion.\\n\\nJust like Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the large-cap stocks to buy according to Matthew Tewksbury\\'s Stevens Capital.\\n\\nPolen Capital, an investment management firm, in its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“For Netflix, we believe the underlying businesses for the company remain strong.

Forbes said the stock sale would be at least in the 20% range for capital gains tax.\\n\\n\"Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,\" Musk tweeted.\\n\\nMuch is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you support this?\\n\\n— Lorde Edge (@elonmusk) November 6, 2021\\n\\nShares fell 7.6% in early trade on Germany\\'s Tradegate index on Monday.\\n\\nMusk owns a 23% stake in the electric vehicle company, which is currently the world\\'s most valuable.

However, he also has a duty to act in shareholders’ interests which he hasn’t done in this situation because the incident has already destabilised the company’s valuation.”\\n\\nSome analysts said that, while a huge stock offload is usually seen in a negative light by shareholders, the 10% stock sale would not necessarily move the needle for the company.\\n\\nDemand remains high for Tesla shares among both institutional and retail investors, Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities told Bloomberg.\\n\\nOthers said that it could lead to short sellers targeting the company.\\n\\nWatch: Twitter users tell Musk to sell Tesla shares',\n",

A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\\n\\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nEven so, its market cap, which is more than 50 times revenue, is ridiculous.\\n\\nCrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company, opened for trade Nov. 9 at $285.68 share. The market cap at that price is $65.22 billion. The expected average revenue for its 2022 fiscal year, ending this January, is about $1.41 billion.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nFew question that valuation, but when they do it has an impact. CRWD stock fell by 4.5%, a loss of $2.5 billion, when a single analyst dropped his rating to neutral recently.\\n\\n7 Superstocks That Have Returned Over 10,000% in 30 Years\\n\\nInvestors saw it as a buying opportunity. The stock is back where it was when he made the call.\\n\\nCRWD Stock: What You’re Buying\\n\\nCrowdStrike makes Falcon XDR, a security system meant to protect every corporate device, even in the cloud. Falcon XDR is meant to give security managers complete visibility over their systems, and immediate defense in depth against attacks.\\n\\nDoes it work?\\n\\nWell a public announcement in late August that CrowdStrike had taken a Fortune 500 account from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after a ransomware attack sent CRWD stock up around $40 per share.\\n\\nSuch wins have been consistent for years. CrowdStrike was doing $52 million in business just 5 years ago. Revenue has doubled each year since, through 2021, when it hit $874 million. Yet, CrowdStrike isn’t profitable.\\n\\nStill, with that growth rate it would be foolish not to invest every penny into the business. And it only took out its first significant debt last year, about $770 million worth.\\n\\nCrowdStrike’s most valuable asset is the stock, some of which it’s using to buy SecureCircle, a start-up with 31 employees. SecureCircle offers data loss prevention (DLP) services, which, now when combined with CloudStrike’s products and services, can ensure customers have data “encryption in all three states: in transit, at rest and in use.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA High Wire Act\\n\\nCybersecurity is a high wire act. The state of the art can change on a dime. The details are so esoteric investors may not know what’s happening in time to get out.\\n\\nBut the rewards can be enormous. CrowdStrike went public in June 2019 at about $64 per share, a valuation of $6.6 billion. Since then, investors have seen more than 350% in gains. Shares doubled in just the last year.\\n\\nCrowdStrike has become the second-largest Software as a Service (SaaS) vendor in endpoint security, trailing only Japan’s Trend Micro (OTCMKTS:TMICY). CEO George Kurtz has become an especially bitter rival of Microsoft, accusing it of making the SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI) hack worse.\\n\\nSince then, CrowdStrike has joined other Microsoft security competitors last year to form the Spectra Alliance, which focuses on securing the world of remote work.\\n\\nAfter joining this group, CrowdStrike has been signing partnerships left-and-right. In fact, it has one with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. And, as part of what it calls the CrowdXDR Alliance, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud.\\n\\nThrough the Alliance, CloudStrike hopes to build an industry standard around its eXtended Detection and Response (XDR) system.\\n\\nCrowdStrike has also invested in JumpCloud, building an alternative to Microsoft’s Active Directory technology.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on CrowdStrike\\n\\nCrowdStrike has obviously become a hot player in the increasingly important cybersecurity world. And XDR is the hot new buzzword. Kurtz is the hot new face.\\n\\nThe only problem is that analysts see CrowdStrike as fully valued. The 18 analysts at Tipranks only see around a 9% gain from here over the next year. None are saying sell, but 3 aren’t saying buy.\\n\\nSo long as there is positive momentum in the market and a premium paid for growth and so long as CrowdStrike can stay on top of its niche, you should be fine buying it. That’s true even at these levels.\\n\\nThe trouble is that’s a lot of “ifs.”\\n\\nIf you like it, then you should wait for a fall below the 50-day moving average, like we saw in March, August and early October, before you pounce.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in AMZN and MSFT.

Microsoft was a top contributor in the period because it trades at reasonable free cash flow and earnings valuations, has cloud and digital transformation tailwinds at its back, reported a solid March quarter, and beat Street expectations by a wide margin. Microsoft’s results continued to be strong across the board, with Azure cloud computing revenues up 46% in constantcurrency (“cc”) terms and commercial cloud bookings growth of 38% cc, the best in years. Microsoft also reported robust profitability growth, with operating income expanding 31% and GAAP earnings up 45%.

It is the low-cost provider of mortgages, a significant advantage and competitive strength in a commodity industry. The company has been a beneficiary of rising Indian income levels and improving housing affordability for the expanding middle class. Greater financial inclusion has allowed mortgage provision to extend to a larger portion of India’s population and HDFC is well positioned to benefit from this growth. The company also has an excellent long-term credit record with a focus on profitable growth and has shown good capital allocation over many years.

Here\\'s their take on the company:\\n\\n“Alibaba also detracted from performance as the company continues to remain under regulatory scrutiny from both the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation on antitrust concerns and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on ADR listing requirements. Despite the regulatory overhang, we believe that Alibaba’s competitive positioning and growth outlook remains intact, even if the company must pay fines or modify some business practices. We viewed the current valuation at <20x next twelve month’s earnings as a compelling opportunity to add to our position. Alibaba is the second largest position in the Portfolio.”\\n\\n8.

       " 'Under the capitalist ethos, producers of goods and services strive to find the lowest possible cost threshold while maximizing growth and earnings potential. For decades, the unrivaled manufacturing prowess of the U.S. contributed to its status as the greatest economic power. However, a changing of the guard implies consumers care more deeply about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues — which brings up the case for best ESG stocks to buy.\\n\\nFor starters, the millennial and emerging Generation Z demographics are much more attuned to issues involving sustainability and social equity than prior generations. It’s not just an American phenomenon either. As a study from Hiroshima University indicated, Japanese youth have an eye toward sustainability — and that includes deferring higher pay to associate with a sustainable company. That’s a powerful backdrop for adding the best ESG stocks to your portfolio.\\n\\nFurthermore, a McKinsey & Company article reported that more companies are taking notice of the trend toward ESG demand. Indeed, many of the biggest firms in the world are contributing toward a net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050, aligning their ambitions with that of President Joe Biden’s net-zero-emissions pledge. Theoretically, we could get to a point where ignoring holistic social wellness issues could be detrimental, thereby bolstering the best ESG stocks.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nOf course, that doesn’t mean pursuing environmental sustainability and social governance is an easy box to check off. As the McKinsey article indicated, businesses everywhere would like to decarbonize if money was no object. Unfortunately, it is an object which requires an overhaul in approach. Also, companies will have to take intrepid risks to make sustainability work, which is a constant challenge even for the best ESG stocks.\\n\\n7 Superstocks That Have Returned Over 10,000% in 30 Years\\n\\nNevertheless, the growing impact of climate change means that we cannot ignore sustainable solutions. So with that in mind, below are some of the best ESG stocks to consider.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) Orsted (OTCMKTS:DNNGY) Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) Waste Management (NYSE:WM) Unilever (NYSE:UL) First Graphene (OTCMKTS:FGPHF)\\n\\nAs with any investment sector, you’re going to need to perform your due diligence — even for the best ESG stocks. True, you might feel less aggrieved if you lose money on sustainable companies. But the reality is that losing money stinks, no matter the extraction of a moral victory or not. Therefore, take the same precautions as you would anything else.\\n\\nBest ESG Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.\\n\\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAs one of the biggest technology firms in the world — and whose co-founder is often the target of conspiracy theories — you wouldn’t necessarily peg Microsoft as one of the best ESG stocks to buy. A company that’s indispensable in the workforce of the old normal and new normal? Sure. A video-gaming giant which competes robustly with other platforms? Absolutely.\\n\\nHowever, it’s now time to look at MSFT stock in another light, that of genuinely forwarding the narrative for best ESG stocks. For one thing, Microsoft asserts that it “has been carbon neutral across the world since 2012 and commits to being carbon negative by 2030.” Furthermore, it maintains a strong position on water scarcity, committing to reducing consumption and “replenishing water in the regions” it operates.\\n\\nFinally, Microsoft is one of the leaders among blue-chip companies to promote inclusivity. That includes extending opportunities for the more than one billion people in the world with disabilities. Now if we can only figure out a way for Windows to stop bugging out and giving us the occasional blue screen of death, MSFT stock would be just perfect.\\n\\nSherwin-Williams (SHW) A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.\\n\\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIf you suspected that Sherwin-Williams had a banner year in 2020 thanks to the unexpected skyrocketing of real estate demand, you’d be right. When Dec. 31 inked its way into the history books, Sherwin-Williams had generated $18.4 billion in revenue in the trailing 365 days, up 2.8% from 2019’s tally. Percentage wise, that’s nothing to write home about. Given the impact of the novel coronavirus, though, that’s saying something.\\n\\nBetter yet, Sherwin-Williams is having an even more robust year in 2021, with its trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue at $19.7 billion. So long as the fourth quarter performs reasonably well, SHW stock should enjoy another year of sizable expansion. But how does that make Sherwin-Williams one of the best ESG stocks to consider for your portfolio?\\n\\nSurprisingly, the company has a remarkable list of ESG accomplishments, including reducing carbon emissions by nearly 17% since 2017 and cutting employee injuries by almost half since 2015. Moreover, Sherwin-Williams developed the first non-BPA (bisphenol A) epoxy coatings for food and beverage cans.\\n\\n7 Sharing Economy Stocks to Buy as the Pandemic Changes Work\\n\\nPlus, with real estate demand still strong, SHW stock proves that you can be responsible and profitable.\\n\\nBest ESG Stocks: Orsted (DNNGY) Orsted factory and logo\\n\\nSource: oleschwander / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAs the largest energy company in Denmark (and a sustainable one to boot), Orsted offers in many ways a double shot for those seeking the best ESG stocks. For one thing, the underlying country is one of the leaders in environmental considerations. For instance, a Bloomberg report noted that Denmark was (at time of writing) featured at the top of Transparency International’s ranking for transparent ethical investing measures.\\n\\nMoreover, the world’s least corrupt nation wants to spread clarity in the often opaque world of ESG investing. Moving forward, such a cooperative partnership between governments and businesses may be necessary to fully decarbonize our global economy.\\n\\nNaturally, such a supportive backdrop allows Orsted to do what’s necessary to establish a sustainable business while keeping shareholders happy. Featuring a range of clean energy and storage solutions, Orsted disproves the myth that even the best ESG stocks struggle to pad the bottom line. In fact, the company posted five-consecutive years of positive net income between 2016 through 2020. And with Orsted on pace to generate $3 billion in net income, you might as well make that six.\\n\\nFive Below (FIVE) storefront of a five below (FIVE)\\n\\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhile much of the investment hype in 2020 and for most of this year has been focused on the rise of newly minted millionaires and billionaires, the problem with playing too hard into this narrative is that it’s an unrealistic one. Broadly speaking, the widening wealth gap of course favors the ultra-affluent, leaving most everyone else scrambling for the scraps.\\n\\nTherefore, you might say that Five Below is by default one of the best ESG stocks to consider because of its underlying business. A discount retailer specializing in products that are priced no more than $5, Five Below is a cut above your typical discount-dollar stores. While grabbing something for a buck is appealing on many levels, the products tend to be disastrously cheap. With Five Below, you get a nice balance between price and quality.\\n\\n7 Social Media Stocks to Buy on the Heels of the Dead Pinterest Deal\\n\\nFurthermore, the company has performed very well despite the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2021 of $1.96 billion up over 6% from the prior. As well, its TTM revenue currently stands at $2.58 billion. Thus, a reasonable final quarter to round out the year should see FIVE stock deliver another outstanding performance.\\n\\nBest ESG Stocks: Waste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\\n\\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOrdinarily, you wouldn’t be in a hurry to look up Waste Management if you’re focused on the best ESG stocks to buy. After all, ESG is about sustainability and efficient use of materials; So they don’t end up in a landfill. As an operator of landfills, the optics are at the very least awkward for WM stock.\\n\\nHowever, no matter how much people talk about buying the best ESG stocks, waste disposal is a reality. For years, the U.S. has been exporting its recycling materials to developing nations for storage and eventual processing. While the process seemed to be a viable short-term solution, those nations receiving American trash got tired of it. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, but it does leave us in quite a pickle.\\n\\nFortunately, Waste Management is dedicated to being part of the solution, not the problem. In addition to its recycling centers, the company facilitated a number of changes, including shifting its collection fleet to incorporate alternative fuels. Moreover, at WM controlled sites, the locations use 100% renewable energy.\\n\\nAs well, Waste Management prioritizes social and governance concerns, articulating that 100% of WM employees are paid a living wage.\\n\\nUnilever (UL) The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\\n\\nSource: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAs the manufacturer and distributor of popular household goods, along with food and beverages, the usually boring Unilever saw a conspicuous demand spike during the Covid-related lockdowns. With restaurants and other non-essential public establishments closed for much of 2020, companies like Unilever enjoyed a cynical benefit. Honestly, what else were you going to do during that awful period?\\n\\nMoreover, many people are still stuck at home with the coronavirus still running wild. With that in mind, Unilever demand remains robust based on TTM revenue. And just as importantly, the company is maintaining strength in free cash flow throughout 2021.\\n\\nBut what really stood out in terms of best ESG stocks is Unilever’s commitment to social equity. Last year, management took cues from the lessons it learned. And as a result, the company has made a pledge for racial justice, which include substantive initiatives like increased spending with diverse suppliers.\\n\\n5 Stocks Set to 10x Next Year\\n\\nIn turn, it’s good to see companies walking the walk, proving that you can operate ethically and profitably.\\n\\nBest ESG Stocks: First Graphene (FGPHF) A digital illustration of 3D graphene molecules.\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nInvariably, while it feels great to buy the best ESG stocks, many tend to be plucked from established blue chips. In other words, they can be quite boring. If you want to live a dangerously, however, you might want to check out what First Graphene has to offer.\\n\\nBefore I get into it, FGPHF — as you might tell from its unusual ticker symbol — is an over-the-counter play: that means you can expect plenty of volatility and low volume. Additionally, the equity unit is priced at 15 cents a pop, which makes it quite hazardous.\\n\\nI would know. I own a modest amount of shares, and let’s just say I’m not exactly thrilled.\\n\\nThat aside, I think First Graphene has huge potential for the patient. As the top research-and-development firm in the graphene space, First Graphene sells additive compounds to bolster strength and resilience of building materials and industrial equipment, thereby reducing carbon emissions on a net basis.\\n\\nAnd yes, mundane materials like concrete emit a surprising amount of carbon. Therefore, by mitigating concrete usage and waste, First Graphene could turn out to be a gamechanger years down the line. Thus, you definitely need to watch this space.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in FGPHF.

       " \"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market, the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap ETF (EPS) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 02/23/2007.\\n\\nThe fund is sponsored by Wisdomtree. It has amassed assets over $632.70 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.\\n\\nWhy Large Cap Value\\n\\nLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.\\n\\nWhile value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.\\n\\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\\n\\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.51%.\\n\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\n\\nIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\n\\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 24.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.\\n\\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 5.05% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc-Cl A (GOOGL).\\n\\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 27.55% of total assets under management.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPerformance and Risk\\n\\nEPS seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Index before fees and expenses. The WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Index is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance of earnings-generating companies within the large-capitalization segment of the U.S. Stock Market.\\n\\nThe ETF has added roughly 26.13% so far this year and it's up approximately 35.81% in the last one year (as of 11/09/2021). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $37.69 and $49.43.\\n\\nThe ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 22.88% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 503 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\\n\\nAlternatives\\n\\nWisdomTree U.S. LargeCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, EPS is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\\n\\nThe iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $57.86 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $88.66 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.\\n\\nBottom-Line\\n\\nPassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

They are the seven largest U.S.-listed stocks to buy yet to reach $1 trillion. However, I wanted to make sure that each of the names had a shot at getting there by the end of 2023.\\n\\nNvidia is firing on all cylinders right now.\\n\\nIn the six months ended Aug. 1, the company generated free cash flow (FCF) of $4.04 billion, 92% higher than a year earlier. On a trailing 12-month (TTM) basis, Nvidia’s FCF is $6.67 billion. Based on its market cap of $745.03 billion, it has an FCF yield of less than 1%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat’s what happens when your share price appreciates by nearly 135% year-to-date. On the bright side, it has an FCF margin above 30%. If it continues to grow its quarterly revenue by 68% year-over-year, as it did in Q2 2022, I don’t think it will have any trouble joining the club in 2022.\\n\\nTo get there, it needs to add $255 billion in market cap. With 2.53 billion shares outstanding, that translates to a $101 per share increase, or 34%.\\n\\nWhile I believe that Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang is one of the best executives in America, the odds of getting to $1 trillion in 2022 are going to be tough.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\\n\\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWarren Buffett’s company currently has a market cap of $654 million. So, Berkshire needs to add $346 billion in value to gain entry into the club. That’s a little more than a 50% increase.\\n\\nI don’t want to rain on the company’s parade. However, since 1965, BRK has appreciated by 34% or more in 16 years, the last being in 1998. The closest it’s come since was a 32.7% gain in 2013.\\n\\nOver the past five years, Berkshire’s increased its market value by an average of 12.3% per year. It needs to double that return to hit $1 trillion by the end of 2023.\\n\\n7 Superstocks That Have Returned Over 10,000% in 30 Years\\n\\nThat’s not to say that Buffett doesn’t have it in him to pull off the unthinkable.\\n\\nBloomberg recently reported that Berkshire invested $300 million in Paytm in 2018, an India-based payments firm. It plans to go public at a valuation of $20 billion, which would value its investment at $510 million, a 70% return over three years.\\n\\nPlus, popular IPOs, especially fintechs, tend to sprint out of the gate. That could easily double the holding company’s return when it’s able to cash out.\\n\\nThat’s an impressive return, but if Berkshire makes this prestigious group, it will need to deliver something much more significant to move the needle. I think at this point, only two things will do the trick.\\n\\nEither Buffett bags the elephant, or he does as I suggested in 2017 and spins off some of the company’s cash into smaller, more agile businesses that can acquire smaller growth companies that can move the needle faster.\\n\\nI don’t think he will, but you never know. No one thought Apple would be Berkshire’s largest holding, but here we are.\\n\\nNext Trillion-Dollar Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe Taiwan semiconductor giant hasn’t had the kind of year in the markets Nvidia has had. It’s up 5.5% YTD, less than 1/20th Nvidia’s performance over the same period.\\n\\nOf course, TSM’s in a different business than Nvidia. It manufactures the actual chips. Nvidia merely designs them, outsourcing the production to a fabrication plant run by companies like Taiwan Semiconductor.\\n\\n“Remember that Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are two totally different business models,” Gina Sanchez, chief market strategist at Lido Advisors, told CNBC’s ‘Trading Nation’ on Oct. 26. “Taiwan Semiconductor is a pure play on the fab. Nvidia is a fabless play on innovation. … This investment by Facebook will benefit Nvidia because Nvidia is the fastest chip out there.”\\n\\nHowever, what investors get with TSM is a company with almost $9 billion in TTM FCF and an FCF yield of 1.5%, nearly double Nvidia’s FCF yield. Further, it trades at 11.7x sales compared to Nvidia’s 54x forward earnings.\\n\\nIf investors are looking for a value play on the semiconductor market, TSM is it.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) A sign for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM).\\n\\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTo get to $1 trillion, JPM will have to double its market cap. Up 43% YTD and 52% over the past 52 weeks, CEO Jamie Dimon will have to pull a rabbit out of his hat to reach the trillion-dollar mark by the end of 2022.\\n\\nHowever, if interest rates move higher, it’s entirely possible it could achieve the task by the end of 2023.\\n\\nThe bank reported Q3 2021 results in mid-October. They were reasonably healthy with a 24% increase in profits to $11.7 billion, or $3.74 a share, 71 cents higher than the analyst expectation. Revenue was up 2% to $30.4 billion. That was $600 million higher than the consensus estimate.\\n\\n10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy After Winning in Q3\\n\\nOther tidbits include a 5% increase in average loans and a 19% increase in average deposits during the quarter. In addition, with the economy improving, it released $2.1 billion in credit reserves, which is why the profits were so high in the quarter.\\n\\nFor all of 2021, it expects net interest income — the difference between what it generates in revenue from interest-bearing assets and what it pays out on those assets — to be $52.5 billion.\\n\\nAs interest rates rise, JPMorgan will make more from its customers, not less, moving all of the numbers I’ve mentioned higher.\\n\\nWill it be enough to double its stock by the end of 2023? Probably not. That said, its stock has delivered a total return of 71.6% over the past year. So if it does it in 2022, it will come close to $1 trillion.\\n\\nNext Trillion-Dollar Stocks to Buy: Alibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group (BABA) headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China\\n\\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThere are about eight weeks left in 2021. To date, Alibaba’s lost 29% of its value. That means it started the year with a market cap of $637 billion. If it went the other way and gained 29%, it would be within shouting distance of $1 trillion.\\n\\nAlas, that’s not what happened. Instead, Alibaba’s been hammered from every direction. It is not an easy time to be an Alibaba shareholder. Harris Douglas Asset Manager Paul Harris recently told the Cantech Letter that investors shouldn’t be surprised for its share price to remain stuck in neutral.\\n\\n“‘I don’t own Alibaba but I will say that it’s an interesting company. I think the difficult part of it is that China is really cracking down on a lot of these big tech companies and so that has hurt many of the Chinese tech companies,’ said Harris, speaking on BNN Bloomberg on Tuesday,” the Cantech Letter reported.\\n\\n“‘The other issue is a lot of pressure [from] the United States for them to move to GAAP reporting,’ Harris said.”\\n\\nHowever, it’s hard to ignore that the company’s active consumer base is almost 1.2 billion people. In Q1 2021, it generated an FCF of $3.2 billion. Over the past 12 months, its free cash flow was $26.9 billion.\\n\\nBased on its market cap of $452 billion, it has an FCF yield of 6.0%. That’s not value territory, in my opinion, but it’s close. So should the Chinese government cut it some slack, I could see a big move in 2022.\\n\\nThat said, the odds are slim that it will get to $1 trillion in 2022.\\n\\nVisa (V) several Visa (V) branded credit cards\\n\\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe good news from Visa’s Q4 2021 report issued on Oct. 26 was that its revenues of $6.6 billion were $100 million higher than analyst estimates while earnings per share were $1.62, six cents higher than the consensus, and 50 cents higher than Q4 2020.\\n\\nThe bad news is that the company expects revenues to increase in the mid-teens in 2022, below what analysts expect for the coming year. Instead, they believe revenues will grow by 18.3%.\\n\\n“Visa’s commentary ‘raised debates on whether the guide was conservative or other issues are pressuring Visa’s business’ such as pricing and incentives, Wolfe Research analyst Darrin Peller wrote.\\n\\nHe sees the outlook as conservative on macro assumptions but noted that the implied increases in incentives, excluding travel, are largely in-line with historic trends, MarketWatch reported.\\n\\n7 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks That Should Grace Your Portfolio\\n\\nOne area where the company expects to see growth is within payroll and the gig economy. It is seeing a serious increase in the use of earned-wage-access technology to get workers paid faster.\\n\\nAs the company’s fintech participation increases, investors can expect Visa’s revenue and profits to accelerate. That will undoubtedly have a positive effect on Visa’s share price.\\n\\nAt a market cap of $443 billion, Visa is a longshot to hit $1 trillion by the end of 2023.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\\n\\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI wasn’t going to write about the next trillion-dollar company without including a healthcare stock. JNJ has the highest market cap in the healthcare sector by a slight margin over UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest private provider of health insurance in the U.S.\\n\\nOver the past 10 years, Johnson & Johnson’s annualized total return is 27%. It currently has a market cap of $435 billion. To get to $1 trillion by the end of 2023, it needs to generate an annual return of 52%.\\n\\nI could see it reaching that return rate in one of the two next years but not both. Therefore, I would say it’s more realistic for it to hit $1 trillion in late 2024 or the first half of 2025.\\n\\nOne thing that won’t help the company get there is the Mayo Clinic study of almost 9,000 patients between February and July of this year. It found that the J&J Covid-19 vaccine was 73.6% effective. However, because only 60 out of 8,999 people in the study got Covid-19, the study could not determine the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing death.\\n\\n“‘What is becoming more clear with time is that the single-dose regimen of the [Johnsons & Johnson Covid-19] vaccine seems to be inferior to the mRNA vaccines in terms of [vaccine effectiveness],’ Sajadi wrote, comparing the J&J vaccine to a different type of Covid-19 vaccine that is made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna,” CNN Business reported on Nov. 2.\\n\\nHowever, the company only expects to generate $2.5 billion from the vaccine in 2021. That’s less than 3% of its TTM revenue of $91.5 billion.\\n\\nSo, I don’t think shareholders should worry too much about the lack of revenue from Covid-19 holding back its stock. It’s got plenty of levers to pull to get to $1 trillion in time. It’s certainly one of the stocks to buy that has a chance.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       " \"Nvidia and Lockheed Martin are teaming up to use Omniverse to predict forest fires. (Image: Nvidia)\\n\\nNvidia (NVDA) is going all in on the metaverse, a collection of interconnected persistent online worlds, with announcements related to its own Omniverse platform during the company’s GTC 2021 conference on Nov. 9. In addition to new capabilities for Omniverse, including AR and VR functions, the company showed off how third-party firms use Omniverse for everything from predicting the paths of forest fires to developing 5G networks.\\n\\nNvidia’s Omniverse acts as the plumbing for its own open-source metaverse experience, competing with Meta (FB), formerly known as Facebook, and Microsoft’s (MSFT) metaverse solutions.\\n\\nThe platform is already available, but at GTC Nvidia is showing off its new Omniverse BR, which brings real-time ray-traced VR to the Omniverse suite, Omniverse Remote, which adds augmented reality functionality, and Omniverse Showroom, which lets non-technical users — otherwise known as you and me — mess around with Omniverse tech demos that show off the platform’s rendering and physics technology.\\n\\nNvidia’s take on the metaverse focuses on so-called digital twins, or virtual versions of real-world objects or spaces that people can manipulate and study in computer-generated worlds. The company has already worked with BMW to create a digital twin of one of its factories.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAt GTC, Nvidia said it and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are teaming up with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control to develop digital wins of real forests to better study the impact of fires and help predict their paths.\\n\\nThe companies, according to Nvidia, will set up shop at an AI development lab based in Silicon Valley that will use Nvidia’s Omniverse tech along with Lockheed’s Cognitive Mission Manager AI system to figure out how fires will behave.\\n\\nUsing digital twins of previous fires and current prediction models, the companies plan to deploy the tech to help firefighters respond more quickly to fires. The companies will recreate areas where forest fires have taken place, run simulations of the fires, and use that data to predict the paths of future fires.\\n\\nThen there’s Nvidia’s work with Ericsson (ERIC). Using Omniverse, Ericsson is creating digital twins of cities, including everything from buildings to the trees that line the streets to better understand how to lay out 5G networks. Ericsson is using Nvidia's Omniverse to better understand how to layout 5G cellular antennas. (Image: Nvidia)\\n\\nHigh-speed 5G networks have the potential to enable connections that blow the doors off of even the fastest 4G LTE networks. But they require short-range antennas and their signals are easily interrupted by buildings, trees, heck even people.\\n\\nUsing a digital twin of a city gives Ericsson the ability to see how networks should be set up and where they’ll run into the most interference. Nvidia says Ericsson will also be able to use its Omniverse VR platform so that engineers can literally walk around in their digital cities and change the direction of antennas to see how they work in different locales.\\n\\nFinally, Nvidia showed off how its Omniverse is being used to help the company build out its data for its self-driving vehicle initiative. Using Ominverse, Nvidia is able to create real-world scenarios for virtual autonomous vehicles, and see how sensors including LiDAR and sonar will react out on the road.\\n\\nThe metaverse is still very much in its infancy, and the field is wide open for any company to come in and steal the spotlight away from their competitors.\\n\\nFor its part, Nvidia’s Omnivese will differ from Facebook, which is looking to create a new social networking experience, and Microsoft, which focuses on how the corporate world can use the metaverse though the Xbox may eventually be brought in, too.\\n\\nWhich metaverse will be the most popular? Nvidia looks to have a solid jump on the competition at this point.\\n\\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\\n\\nMore from Dan\\n\\nGoogle hits $2 trillion market cap, joining ranks of Microsoft and Apple Apple SharePlay: How to watch movies and TV shows with up to 33 people at once Facebook's metaverse will still track your every move\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\\n\\nGot a tip?

       " \"With major tech players like Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) staking their claims to the metaverse, its technology has seen a meteoric rise into the mainstream consciousness. According to Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, the advent of metaverse platforms could have significant implications for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, gaming, and more.\\n\\nPowell likened the metaverse to existing virtual universes found in popular online video games such as Second Life, World of Warcraft, and Runescape.\\n\\n“People grew up playing these games and I think that this new stage of the metaverse where you have these goods, these virtual tokens, or these clothing or whatever it is [that] you can take between these different platforms, I think is what people are really excited about now,” Powell told Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nHowever, he stated that iterations of metaverses have and continue to exist and be used every day.\\n\\n“We've seen various versions of metaverse over time,” Powell said. “I mean, you could even look at Fortnite as a metaverse — Roblox (RBLX), Minecraft, Second Life as sort of one of the very first iterations of this.

He attributed it to the rapid mainstream adoption of projects such as NBA Top Shot and CryptoPunks.\\n\\nAccording to Powell, the rising popularity of NFTs is likely derived from younger generations’ familiarity with digital stores of value, like virtual clothes and gear for an online avatar. With the advent of the metaverse and the possibility of many decentralized metaverses, he believes that being able to take digital assets between different platforms, leveraging blockchain capabilities, is what the NFT space will be looking to next.\\n\\n“I don't think there'll be any single metaverse,” Powell said. “And I think it's the same for Facebook, another kind of proprietary platform where I think they'll support these blockchain assets and some representation of them in their world, and they'll all have different rules.

It has amassed assets over $2.34 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\\n\\nWhy Large Cap Blend\\n\\nLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.\\n\\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.\\n\\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.\\n\\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.99%.\\n\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\n\\nETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing.

In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $270.30 and $365.07.\\n\\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 22.51% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 52 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\\n\\nAlternatives\\n\\nInvesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, XLG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.\\n\\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index.

This digital revival project allows viewers around the world to explore ancient Olympia as it stood more than 2,000 years ago through an immersive experience via an interactive mobile app, web-based desktop experience, or a Microsoft HoloLens 2 exhibition at the Athens Olympic Museum. Microsoft company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Microsoft Corp.) (PRNewsfoto/Microsoft Corp.)\\n\\nDigitally preserving ancient Olympia gives people a way to walk through the site during one of history\\'s most important periods — brought to life in a realistic, engaging way that was never before possible. This new form of digital archiving will continue to offer a portal to another era, helping us understand what humanity has achieved in the past and reminding us of what we\\'re capable of today.\\n\\n\"Ancient Olympia: Common Grounds is a unique way of experiencing Greece\\'s proud cultural heritage. Visitors around the world can virtually visit the ancient site of Olympia and experience history firsthand using augmented reality technology,\" said Kyriakos Mitsotakis, prime minister of Greece.\\n\\n\"The project to digitally preserve ancient Olympia is a stunning achievement in cultural heritage, bringing together humanity and cutting-edge technology to benefit the world and empower coming generations with new ways to explore our past,\" said Brad Smith, president and vice chair, Microsoft.\\n\\n\"With the digital representation of the Panhellenic sanctuary of Ancient Olympia, its cultural heritage — but also the values of Olympism, peace, harmony, excellence and noble rivalry — becomes accessible to the whole world through the use of state-of-the-art technology. The digital preservation project, through the use of artificial intelligence and augmented reality technologies, implemented through the cultural sponsorship of Microsoft, promotes and highlights the unique and emblematic archaeological site of Ancient Olympia. This contributes to the research and documentation of monuments, supports the tourism and extroversion of the country as a modern and strong democracy with a long historical and cultural past and unquestionable development dynamics,\" said Lina Mendoni, Hellenic Republic Minister of Culture and Sports.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"We thank the Greek government for the trust and the great partnership it took to make this project a reality. I am looking forward to exploring the different ways we can work together to leverage even further Common Grounds to enhance tourism, education and Greece\\'s brand name to the rest of the world,\" said Theodosis Michalopoulos, general manager for Microsoft Greece Cyprus and Malta.\\n\\nIn total, the project digitally preserves 27 monuments at the site, among them the original Olympic Stadium, the temples of Zeus and Hera, and the workshop of the renowned sculptor Phidias. In the 3D experience, these buildings are recreated in lifelike detail, painstakingly researched by the Hellenic Ministry\\'s expert archaeologists to be as true as possible to their original forms. This includes historical timelines of the site\\'s changes over time and depictions of artifacts from each period.\\n\\nThrough its AI for Cultural Heritage initiative, Microsoft partnered with technology company Iconem, which specializes in digitizing historic sites in 3D, to create the foundational model of ancient Olympia. Both on-the-ground cameras and drones were used to take hundreds of thousands of images of the site, which Microsoft AI processed to create models so precise, they render as photorealistic.\\n\\nThe collaboration between the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports and Microsoft brought together people from diverse backgrounds — theoretical and technical, like archaeologists and developers — and from various parts of the world to work, find new ways to overcome challenges, and eventually find a common ground to make this project come to life — not just to preserve the past with the use of AI technology but also to drive these principles into the future.\\n\\nThese monuments survived thousands of years of weather, war, earthquakes and modernization, and are in need of digital preservation to ensure that all the evidence of the rich history and civil common ground values that the site was built upon is handed over to future generations.\\n\\nThe web experience may be viewed at olympiacommongrounds.gr, and the app may be downloaded on the iOS and Android app stores.\\n\\nThe Ancient Olympia: Common Grounds Exhibition, featuring the HoloLens 2 Virtual Tour, is now open to the public at the Athens Olympic Museum.\\n\\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge.

       " 'OLYMPIA, Greece, Nov. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sport and Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday announced Ancient Olympia: Common Grounds, a new collaboration to digitally preserve and restore ancient Olympia, the original home of the Olympic games, using AI. This digital revival project allows viewers around the world to explore ancient Olympia as it stood more than 2,000 years ago through an immersive experience via an interactive mobile app, web-based desktop experience, or a Microsoft HoloLens 2 exhibition at the Athens Olympic Museum. Microsoft company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Microsoft Corp.) (PRNewsfoto/Microsoft Corp.)\\n\\nDigitally preserving ancient Olympia gives people a way to walk through the site during one of history\\'s most important periods — brought to life in a realistic, engaging way that was never before possible. This new form of digital archiving will continue to offer a portal to another era, helping us understand what humanity has achieved in the past and reminding us of what we\\'re capable of today.\\n\\n\"Ancient Olympia: Common Grounds is a unique way of experiencing Greece\\'s proud cultural heritage. Visitors around the world can virtually visit the ancient site of Olympia and experience history firsthand using augmented reality technology,\" said Kyriakos Mitsotakis, prime minister of Greece.\\n\\n\"The project to digitally preserve ancient Olympia is a stunning achievement in cultural heritage, bringing together humanity and cutting-edge technology to benefit the world and empower coming generations with new ways to explore our past,\" said Brad Smith, president and vice chair, Microsoft.\\n\\n\"With the digital representation of the Panhellenic sanctuary of Ancient Olympia, its cultural heritage — but also the values of Olympism, peace, harmony, excellence and noble rivalry — becomes accessible to the whole world through the use of state-of-the-art technology. The digital preservation project, through the use of artificial intelligence and augmented reality technologies, implemented through the cultural sponsorship of Microsoft, promotes and highlights the unique and emblematic archaeological site of Ancient Olympia. This contributes to the research and documentation of monuments, supports the tourism and extroversion of the country as a modern and strong democracy with a long historical and cultural past and unquestionable development dynamics,\" said Lina Mendoni, Hellenic Republic Minister of Culture and Sports.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"We thank the Greek government for the trust and the great partnership it took to make this project a reality. I am looking forward to exploring the different ways we can work together to leverage even further Common Grounds to enhance tourism, education and Greece\\'s brand name to the rest of the world,\" said Theodosis Michalopoulos, general manager for Microsoft Greece Cyprus and Malta.\\n\\nIn total, the project digitally preserves 27 monuments at the site, among them the original Olympic Stadium, the temples of Zeus and Hera, and the workshop of the renowned sculptor Phidias. In the 3D experience, these buildings are recreated in lifelike detail, painstakingly researched by the Hellenic Ministry\\'s expert archaeologists to be as true as possible to their original forms. This includes historical timelines of the site\\'s changes over time and depictions of artifacts from each period.\\n\\nThrough its AI for Cultural Heritage initiative, Microsoft partnered with technology company Iconem, which specializes in digitizing historic sites in 3D, to create the foundational model of ancient Olympia. Both on-the-ground cameras and drones were used to take hundreds of thousands of images of the site, which Microsoft AI processed to create models so precise, they render as photorealistic.\\n\\nThe collaboration between the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports and Microsoft brought together people from diverse backgrounds — theoretical and technical, like archaeologists and developers — and from various parts of the world to work, find new ways to overcome challenges, and eventually find a common ground to make this project come to life — not just to preserve the past with the use of AI technology but also to drive these principles into the future.\\n\\nThese monuments survived thousands of years of weather, war, earthquakes and modernization, and are in need of digital preservation to ensure that all the evidence of the rich history and civil common ground values that the site was built upon is handed over to future generations.\\n\\nThe web experience may be viewed at olympiacommongrounds.gr, and the app may be downloaded on the iOS and Android app stores.\\n\\nThe Ancient Olympia: Common Grounds Exhibition, featuring the HoloLens 2 Virtual Tour, is now open to the public at the Athens Olympic Museum.\\n\\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. Its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

       " \"By Geoffrey Smith\\n\\nInvesting.com -- Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock drifted down by 0.7% in premarket trade on Wednesday, after the European Union's top court dismissed its appeal against a $2.8 billion antitrust fine levied by the European Commission.\\n\\nThe European Court of Justice upheld the Commission's 2017 ruling that stated Alphabet's Google unit had discriminated against third-party advertisers in the way it presented results for shopping searches. It's one of three antitrust rulings from the EU that have led to over 8 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in fines so far. The other two rulings affected its Adsense business and its dominance of the Android operating system for mobile devices.\\n\\nAlphabet has already separated its Google Shopping business operationally from the core search business in response to the ruling.\\n\\nAlphabet had earlier this week become the third company in history, after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), to reach a market value of $2 trilllion, having risen 67% since the start of the year thanks to a buoyant advertising market.\\n\\nIt was the only one of the Big Tech megacaps whose third-quarter earnings were received posittively, beating expectations for both revenue and earnings handily, as its core advertising business proved relatively immune to the privacy changes on Apple's operating system that hurt other ad-based platforms.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nAlphabet Drifts Lower After Losing EU Fine Appeal\\n\\nExclusive-No takers for Malaysia's 5G plan as major telcos balk over pricing, transparency\\n\\nWizz Air CEO says business class flying bad for environment\",\n",

       " 'After a morning rally, the markets failed to gain traction on Thursday. Perhaps it was the bank and bond market holiday, which were closed for Veterans Day. Either way, it was a sluggish and choppy session. With all of that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Microsoft (MSFT) Top stock trades for MSFT\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nEarly in the week, we were cautioning readers of a potential decline or pause in the broader market. That came to fruition, and it hit market-leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\n\\nMicrosoft was one of the few stocks I was watching this morning, as it pulled back right into its 10-day moving average. Now after an inside day, bulls have something to prove going into the weekend.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nAggressive buyers can be long now against this week’s low. Conservative bulls may wait for a potential inside-and-up day, where Microsoft stock rotates above today’s high and triggers a long position.\\n\\n7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell Before We Reach Christmas\\n\\nOn the upside, $338.75 to $339 would be our first target, followed by the $345 to $346 area.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Marqeta (MQ) Top stock trades for MQ\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nMan, what an ugly day we have here in Marqeta (NASDAQ:MQ). The stock is giving us a bearish engulfing candle, as the stock opened significantly higher on earnings but faded hard and even moved below Wednesday’s low.\\n\\nWe had a nice little falling wedge going in this one too (blue lines), followed by the upside breakout. It would have been a beautiful pattern had shares maintained above $30.\\n\\nFrom here, bulls need to see the stock hold above $23.75. A move below could trigger a drop back down to the $20 area.\\n\\nOn the upside, however, a move back over the 50-day moving average is the first step. That’s followed by a move over $30 and Thursday’s high, putting $32.50-plus in play.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Affirm (AFRM)\\n\\nStory continues Top stock trades for AFRM\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nAffirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) has been incredibly volatile lately, but finished higher by about 13.7% on Thursday. That follows a four-day skid where shares fell 20% from the recent high.\\n\\nHowever, that drop landed the stock at the key $133 level and the 50-day moving average, where it found support before today’s rally.\\n\\nUnfortunately, AFRM stock faded hard from the $165 level. Furthermore, the stock failed to close back above uptrend support (blue line) and the 10-day moving average.\\n\\nThat said, though, Affirm was able to close back above its prior high at $146.90. Above this level, and bulls remain in some form of control, although their grip would become much stronger back above $157.50.\\n\\n7 Top Cryptocurrencies to Catch as Bitcoin Hits All-Time Highs\\n\\nHowever, below $147 keeps the 50-day in play.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Lordstown Motors (RIDE) Daily chart of RIDE stock\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nLordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) had a great day, closing higher by nearly 24%.\\n\\nThe move launched RIDE stock over the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. Bulls must see the stock hold above these moving averages should shares pull back.\\n\\nMore impressive would be for the stock to stay above the 21-week moving average. If the stock can do that and clear $7.50, the $9 level would be in play. Above that opens the door to $10 and the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nHowever, below the 50-day, and bulls must be aware of the risk that RIDE stock retests $4.77.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The stock is still up more than 160% over the past year.\\n\\nCramer also likes ON Semiconductor because of the company’s established position as the “must-buy chipmaker” in the auto industry\\n\\nTo be sure, EV-related stocks have already delivered sizable returns this year. Tesla, for instance, now trades at over $1,000 per share.\\n\\nBut these days, you can use an investing app to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.\\n\\nClean energy Diyana Dimitrova/Shutterstock\\n\\nNo matter where you stand on the topic of climate change, it’s hard to deny that the goal of net-zero emissions has become a major investment theme.\\n\\nCramer likes hydrogen fuel cell technology as a way to gain exposure to the clean energy megatrend, specifically mentioning fuel cell manufacturer Plug Power.\\n\\nWhile he cautioned that the company is still a revenue story (not an earnings story), Cramer is betting that green investors will continue to buy the shares through to the end of the year.\\n\\nSolar panel provider Enphase Energy is another alternative energy stock that Cramer likes.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“There will be bids under Enphase every single time it goes lower,\" he predicted, “and that’s when you can pick some up.”\\n\\nMetaverse SFIO CRACHO/Shutterstock\\n\\nThink of metaverse as an extensive online world where people interact via digital avatars. It’s made possible through the Internet, conventional personal computing, and virtual and augmented reality headsets.\\n\\nCramer thinks the theme is gaining momentum among professional investors.\\n\\n“[W]hat matters is that Wall Street has anointed it, so it works for the next two months at the very least.”\\n\\nHe mentioned three specific companies to gain access to the metaverse: Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), chipmaker Nvidia, and video game software developer Unity Software.\\n\\nBoth Meta and Unity are up around 20% since the beginning of 2021. Nvidia shares, meanwhile, have surged a whopping 139%.\\n\\nCloud computing monticello/Shutterstock\\n\\nCramer is a big fan of cloud computing — and for good reason.\\n\\nAccording to technology researcher Gartner, spending on cloud computing will rise to more than $360 billion in 2022. And Cramer tapped several large-cap tech stocks as the best way to take advantage.\\n\\nCramer likes Microsoft due to its increasingly attractive Azure segment, Salesforce because it goes \"higher all the time,” Adobe for its creativity software, and Snowflake for its expertise in data analytics.\\n\\nTo be sure, none of these stocks are cheap — whether you look at their nominal share prices or valuation metrics. Adobe, for instance, is priced at over $660 apiece with a P/E ratio above 50.\\n\\nBut you don’t have to start big. These days, you can build your own technology portfolio just by using some digital nickels and dimes.\\n\\nEnergy Thaiview/Shutterstock\\n\\nWhile the oil and gas sector isn’t as exciting as the metaverse, Cramer says it shouldn’t be ignored — particularly if you’re looking for income.\\n\\n“If you want yield, go with Chevron,” Cramer said.\\n\\nAs the second-largest oil company in the U.S., Chevron pays a quarterly dividend of $1.34 per share, translating to a healthy annual yield of 4.6%.\\n\\nIf growth and a variable dividend policy are what you want, Cramer recommends Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy.\\n\\nBoth Pioneer and Devon posted record free cash flow in Q3. They’ve also recently announced substantial dividend increases.\\n\\n“Even if oil and gas prices come down, [fund managers are] going to buy these stocks,” Cramer said.\\n\\nA finer idea antoniodiaz/Shutterstock\\n\\nIf you’d rather not pour any new money into stocks right now, it would be tough to blame you.\\n\\nInflation just hit a 31-year high, after all, and it’s only a matter of time before the Fed starts to raise interest rates.\\n\\nIf you want to invest in something that has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market, you might want to consider an overlooked asset — fine art.\\n\\nContemporary artwork has already outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart.\\n\\nInvesting in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra-rich like Cramer.\\n\\nBut with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.\\n\\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

       " 'By David Randall\\n\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - If trading in the shares of Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and other billionaire-owned companies is any indication, Tesla co-founder Elon Musk unloading part of his stake in the company may not be bad for the electric carmaker’s shares over the long term.\\n\\nMusk, who sold roughly $5 billion worth Tesla shares over the last few days, will remain by far the largest single shareholder in Tesla, with approximately 15.5% of the company\\'s outstanding shares after the full sale is completed. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, by comparison, owns about 14% of the online retailer, while Mark Zuckerberg owns about 14% of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc and controls a majority of its Class B stock.\\n\\nBezos, Zuckerberg and Microsoft’s Bill Gates have all sold billions of dollars worth of stock this year, with little discernible impact on their companies’ share price, analysts and investors said.\\n\\nTesla, of course, is not easily comparable to those companies, nor Musk to their billionaire founders. Shares of Tesla are up more than 1,400% over the last two years and trade at a whopping 346 times earnings, and the company tends to elicit extreme opinions from institutional and retail investors.\\n\\nMusk, for his part, is notoriously active on Twitter -- where he asked polled users on whether he should sell 10% of his stake -- and is at least as divisive as the company he co-founded. His recent activity raised questions about a potential violation https://www.reuters.com/business/tesla-shares-fall-after-musks-twitter-poll-backs-stake-sale-2021-11-08 of a 2018 settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring him to have material tweets vetted by a lawyer.\\n\\nStill, many on Wall Street believe the impact of Musk\\'s potential stock sale may be overblown. Tesla shares are down nearly 15% from their Nov. 4 peak, falling following the Twitter poll and rebounding later in recent sessions. They were down 0.5% in choppy trading on Thursday.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\n\\'SMART MOVE\\'\\n\\nMusk selling 10% of his stake in the company is sensible given the surge in the company\\'s shares, which are up more than 50% year-to-date, said Ross Gerber, president of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki and a long-standing shareholder in Tesla.\\n\\n“Every major tech entrepreneur and bitcoin owner is cashing out huge amounts of capital right now for huge profit so for Musk to take some money off the table is a smart move and he just announced it in a very Muskian way,” Gerber said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, “Bezos sells $2 billion and nobody blinks,\" he added, referring to Bezos\\'s sale of approximately $2 billion worth of Amazon stock in early November.\\n\\nBezos has sold approximately $8.8 billion worth of Amazon stock this year, and sold roughly $10 billion worth of Amazon stock last year, the proceeds of which he has used in part to fund his space tourism company known as Blue Origin.\\n\\nThose sales have likely had a \"negligible\" impact on the stock price of Amazon.com, said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at Loop Capital. Amazon’s shares are up 7.8% this year, underperforming the S&P 500’s 23.8% gain as investors have moved into cyclical stocks and rotated out of last year\\'s strong performers.\\n\\n\"No one really … thinks Bezos has less confidence in the company’s prospects. Amazon is so big and so liquid it doesn’t really move the needle,\" he said.\\n\\nZuckerberg, meanwhile, has sold shares nearly every day this year through a periodic sale agreement. Those sales have had no \"discernable\" impact on the company\\'s share price, said Joe Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research. Shares of the company are up 20.7% this year.\\n\\nThe closest comparison to Musk\\'s decision to sell part of his stake may be Bill Gates, who divested his ownership in Microsoft by selling more than 20 million shares each quarter for more than a dozen years, analysts said.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s shares continued to rise despite that consistent selling in part because investors saw the sales as part of Gates\\' plan to give to charity and not an indication of his faith in the company, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has an outperform rating on Tesla shares.\\n\\nMusk\\'s selling aside, investors who have a bone to pick with Tesla have found plenty of targets.\\n\\nGeorge Schultze, head of Schultze Asset Management, said the share sales, together with Tesla\\'s high valuation at a time when automakers such as General Motors are expanding into the electric vehicle market, suggest Tesla\\'s rally may cool.\\n\\n\"If you put it all together it’s a sign of potential market top in Tesla stock,\" he said.\\n\\n(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Nick Zieminski)',\n",

PROG stock is a meme stock.\\n\\nRight now PROG stock is the entrenched domicile of Reddit’s apes staging a late in-the-game coup against the outfit’s bear population.\\n\\nIndications are 34% to upwards of 50% of Progenity’s shares are held short. That makes the biotech one of the market’s most-heavily wagered against in terms of float.\\n\\nAnd while it’s nice to dream about another successful short squeeze campaign like January’s GameStop (NYSE:GME) squeeze, which put Reddit on Wall Street’s radar, most schemes of that nature fail.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat if you’re the type of investor looking more seriously at Progenity and its business as a sustainable venture in your portfolio?\\n\\nAt the moment and probably for more than a few weeks to come, following this quarter’s sales miss and ongoing red ink — a peek at the rearview mirror in PROG stock and why we’re even discussing those shares makes sense before making any buy decisions.\\n\\nPROG Stock Weekly Price Chart Progenity (PROG) bearish lower high pattern with ominous stochastics points towards deeper correction in meme play PROG stock\\n\\nSource: Charts by TradingView\\n\\nIn the immediate aftermath of PROG stock’s earnings release shares are off just over 10%. Some may see the price action as punitive. But given October’s rally and shares as low as 66 cents in late August, I’d define it as profit-taking.\\n\\nThe other observation is profit-taking in PROG is likely to turn into a full-blown and deeper correction.\\n\\nFurther, the reality is the staying power of apes mostly responsible for Progenity’s swing higher is typically unreliable and of the one-trick pony variety.\\n\\nMost schemes aren’t GME stock or an AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Also, following PROG’s report, a miss is a miss.\\n\\nAll told, I strongly suspect bears aren’t going to miss this opportunity, as well as the one on the price chart featuring a tenuous higher-low pattern and ominous stochastics setup.\\n\\nGiven the history of meme stocks and short-squeeze plays, a move towards much tinier small-cap levels near $1.00 – $1.50 and deeper support shouldn’t be dismissed.\\n\\nIf you think you’re a buyer of PROG stock, holding off looks like a very good idea in our estimation.\\n\\nBottom-line though, if readers see things differently, agreeably please look to hedge what’s a much riskier risk-asset with a longer-term bull call spread, stock collar or married put strategy.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Chris Tyler did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       " '(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. is close to overtaking Walt Disney Co. in market value for the first time since last year, after the amusement park owner’s earnings stoked concerns about slowing subscriber growth in its streaming business.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nWhy Hong Kong Is Building Apartments the Size of Parking Spaces Farmers Take on ‘Post-Apocalyptic’ Food Crisis Do Prisons Deserve a Second Chance? Greece’s Popular Islands Are Crowded — With Plastic\\n\\nA 25% advance since the end of July has boosted Netflix’s market value to $287 billion. Disney is poised to see its market value shrink to about $300 billion when markets open on Thursday, falling 4.9% in premarket trading.\\n\\nWhile Netflix’s subscriber growth has been boosted by hit shows such as Squid Game, additions to the Disney+ streaming app missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday evening. The Disney World theme-park owner has made the family streaming product its major focus for growth in coming years.\\n\\nFor Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne, streaming is key to Disney’s investment case. His overweight rating “is based on the view that Disney is one of a shortlist of global streaming platforms that can achieve significant scale and profitability.” But he doesn’t see that priced into the shares yet.\\n\\nWall Street is generally more bullish on Disney than Netflix. About 78% of analysts have buy ratings on the former and none recommend selling, while 73% recommend buying Netflix and five have sell ratings. Average price targets imply 15% upside for Disney and 5.3% for Netflix.\\n\\nWidening Premium\\n\\nNetflix shares trade at a widening premium to Disney’s based on Wall Street’s preferred valuation measure, enterprise value to projected earnings excluding costs like interest and taxes. Netflix is priced at about twice Disney’s enterprise value to projected Ebitda, according to Bloomberg data.\\n\\nThe premium is due to a chasm in the amount of revenue the companies generate per streaming subscriber, according to Geetha Ranganathan, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Netflix customers contribute almost three times the average revenue per month than Disney+ subscribers.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“Disney’s singular aim was to garner that Netflix-type multiple, and they’ve succeeded mostly,” said Ranganathan. “The big question is whether Disney can continue to exceed expectations for streaming subscriber growth without sacrificing profitability.”\\n\\nRivian’s Starry Debut\\n\\nAnother valuation debate right now surrounds Rivian Automotive Inc. The electric vehicle maker surged 29% in its first day of trading after attracting a flurry of retail investor buying. That pushed its market capitalization to $86 billion, above that of Ford Motor Co., despite having no meaningful revenue.\\n\\nRivian continued its rally on Thursday, rising 9% in premarket trading. It was the most-traded stock on Fidelity’s brokerage platform on Wednesday, with buy orders totaling nearly three times second-ranked Tesla Inc.\\n\\nRivian’s surge outpaced the average performance of this year’s technology debuts, which have jumped by an average of 23%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Among tech IPOs that raised at least $1 billion, Rivian had the best debut session since Kanzhun Ltd. surged 96% in June.\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk unloaded $5 billion of stock in the electric car-maker, shortly after holding a poll on Twitter over whether he should sell 10% of his massive stake in the company.

       " 'Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock fell 10% on November 9, despite reporting sales 36% higher than a year ago. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) headquarters\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhat made analysts hit the sell button was evidence that Palantir’s government growth is slowing, and that its application to commercial markets remains iffy.\\n\\n“If Palantir is ‘just another’ government contractor, why were we paying almost 35 times revenue for the stock?” investors asked. And I’ll ask: Why are you even paying 31.3 times revenue?—i.e. the price to sales ratio on November 10.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThat’s what Palantir has yet to prove.\\n\\nClosed Source\\n\\nMore important, why are you paying a premium for a company that rejects the main technology lesson of the century?\\n\\nThat lesson is open source. The more eyes you get on the code, the faster the code base can rise. Even if most benefits go to users, open source works best. Even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) finally surrendered to it. And in the process created a $2.5 trillion in market cap with its Azure cloud.\\n\\n7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell Before We Reach Christmas\\n\\nPalantir software is completely proprietary. So far as users go, it’s a black box. Agencies buy what it does, and what it does can be cool. The software did, after all, help find Osama Bin Laden.\\n\\nBut most defense software contractors sell for half Palantir’s valuation, about 13-15 times sales. In the secrets business, software is the ultimate secret. Palantir thinks it can generate 30% annual growth through 2025 with its commercial offering, Palantir Foundry. Palantir recently funded 10 start-ups to prove Foundry’s value in industries ranging from mining to media.\\n\\nBut the success of Foundry remains a speculation, because the underlying business remains opaque. That’s why some analysts are calling Palantir stock “the ultimate bear trap”\\n\\nNo Politics, Thanks\\n\\nWhat’s possible with Foundry can be seen in a recent Palantir press release describing how its software helped Rio Tinto (OTCMKTS:RTNTF) build a tunnel to supply a smelter in British Columbia.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut that Palantir chose to highlight a mining project illustrates how devoted it is to politics. Tech workers tilt left because creativity is the gating factor to growth in a technology age. Creative people can come from anywhere, love anyone, and require nurturing to do their best work.\\n\\nBut that’s not how co-founders Alex Karp and Peter Thiel roll. Thiel, in fact, is founding an explicitly right-wing university in Austin, Texas/ Any academic endeavor that starts by rejecting open inquiry will fail, but Thiel certainly has the right to throw money at it. Just as Karp has the right to his devotion to a national security state.\\n\\nPersonally, I would rather toss politics aside when analyzing Palantir. But that’s hard because its stance on behalf of closed software is inherently political. Only the select get knowledge in a closed source world. I’ve covered technology for 40 years now, and if I know anything is wrong, it’s that. You can build a niche on proprietary advantage, but you can’t run the world. Microsoft could buy Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) nearly 8 times over because Oracle was late to the open source cloud.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on PLTR Stock\\n\\nBargain hunters like Cathie Woods of ARK Innovation (NYSEARCA:ARKK) see the recent fall in Palantir as an opportunity. The ARK Funds are active traders and sold Palantir as it rose before earnings.\\n\\nThere are also pension funds that loaded up on Palantir before the earnings came out.\\n\\nPersonally, I wouldn’t touch Palantir stock with a barge pole. It’s not because of Peter Thiel’s politics. It’s because he and Karp reject the technology that made the cloud, and the business approach that can save the world. It’s called working together, with everyone’s eyes on the prize, and it works.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in MSFT.

       " 'As Sony Group Corporation SONY observes the first anniversary of its PlayStation 5 (PS5) gaming console today, the celebrations are likely to be muted. Despite scripting a blockbuster market entry with products flying off shelves and selling 10 million units within July to become the fastest Sony console to reach the tally, it has since fallen behind its predecessor PS4 owing to the dearth of essential components. To add to the woes, management has reportedly reduced the PS5 production outlook for the current fiscal by 1 million to 15 million due to supply chain disruptions, severely denting its holiday season sale. This is likely to offer an opportunity to rival gaming consoles like Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT Xbox Series X and Nintendo Co. Ltd.’s NTDOY Switch to poach on prospective buyers or those sitting on the fence, although the global shortage of semiconductor chips is expected to affect their production schedule as well.\\n\\nWhat Ails Sony?\\n\\nSony had previously targeted production of more than 16 million PS5 units for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2022. However, the company has been saddled with various logistics issues and a shortage of vital components, making it hard to have a steady supply throughout the year. Moreover, uneven coronavirus vaccine rollouts across developing nations from where it procures the bulk of its raw materials have made the supplies highly unpredictable and irregular, affecting the regular production schedule. The manufacturing snag has dealt a blow to the Japan-based conglomerate as it aimed to capitalize on the uptick in pandemic-induced nesting activities — games, streaming video, and home fitness. This, in turn, has left the door ajar for its rivals to score big in the imminent holiday season, with their gaming consoles up and running.\\n\\nFeatures Loaded\\n\\nNot all is lost for Sony though, as it has loaded the product with updated graphics, a newly-redesigned controller, and a collection of exclusive games. With a powerful 8-core AMD Zen 2 processor, 10.3 teraflops of graphics power, gorgeous 4K visuals, and an immersive end-user experience, the PS5 promises one of the best performances witnessed in a gaming console. Moreover, PS5 loads games about 10 to 20 seconds faster than the PS4 Pro and can even read physical discs a few minutes faster, making it an ideal choice for tech-savvy gamers.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHow are Rivals Faring?\\n\\nAlthough Microsoft initially faced certain supply chain issues for its Xbox Series X, it is likely to have avoided the pitfalls for a steady supply of products during the holiday season. Moreover, Microsoft has several games up its sleeves for release to cash in on the frenzy, namely Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, and Age of Empires 4 while Sony does not have any notable first-party games for the upcoming holiday release.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring first-quarter fiscal 2022, Microsoft’s gaming revenues increased 16% year over year, driven by higher engagement levels. Revenues from Xbox hardware surged 166%, driven by strong demand for new consoles. For second-quarter fiscal 2022, Microsoft expects gaming revenues to be up in the high single digits on solid demand for the next generation Xbox Series X and S gaming consoles. \\r\\n\\r\\nNintendo is grappling with supply chain disruptions and global chip shortages, forcing it to trim its sales forecast for 2021 by 6% to 24 million units. Similar to Sony, it acknowledged that it would face a tough time meeting the surge in demand during the holiday season. Nintendo has particularly flourished during the pandemic with its social simulation game titled Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but a dearth of such blockbuster games in the current season is likely to hit sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Nintendo recently launched the Switch OLED model, which is arguably one of its best models produced so far, it is unlikely to translate into a huge success. Moreover, early data reveal that most buyers are likely upgraders rather than new customers, which reduces the incremental earning potential from software sales.\\n\\nCatch Up Game: Quick Fixes\\n\\nIn order to bridge the demand-supply gap, Sony is resorting to some unconventional quick fixes as it expediated PS5 shipments to the United Kingdom through three chartered flights out of South Korea. About 12 articulated lorries were required to ferry the gaming consoles from the airport’s cargo hub to the various U.K. distribution centers and retail stores to cater to the huge Christmas demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill these short-term measures suffice?

       " \"(Bloomberg) -- Beaten-down Chinese technology stocks are getting a fresh lease of life and some strategists are calling a turn.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nWhy Hong Kong Is Building Apartments the Size of Parking Spaces Farmers Take on ‘Post-Apocalyptic’ Food Crisis Hong Kong's New Museum Tries to Please Art World — and Beijing Greece’s Popular Islands Are Crowded — With Plastic\\n\\nHaving buckled under the weight of government crackdowns for much of the year, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index has risen 16% in little more than a month. It’s still down 45% since hitting a record in February, a move that wiped out $500 billion in market value.\\n\\n“The worst is likely behind us in terms of the regulation intensity and the corresponding shocks to the market,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist Kinger Lau wrote in a note after conversations with clients.\\n\\nNotably, a top regulator said last month that they expect to achieve significant progress in crackdowns against fintech firms before the end of the year. And a mandate for President Xi Jinping to potentially rule for life may mean policy continuity and fewer regulatory surprises.\\n\\nThe Golden Dragon gauge climbed 5.1% on Thursday alone, helped by a plethora of positive news that may have boosted investor confidence in the group of stocks. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com’s Singles’ Day shopping festival posted record sales, while Didi Global Inc. was reported to be preparing to relaunch its apps in China by the end of the year, which the ride-hailing company called hearsay.\\n\\nThe likes of UBS Group AG and BlackRock Inc. agree the worst is likely over as far as Chinese government crackdowns are concerned.\\n\\n“Regulatory headwinds abating should also provide some space for earnings -- particularly in the internet sectors -- to rebound,” UBS strategist Niall MacLeod wrote in a note Thursday.\\n\\nWhat’s more, there’s growing optimism about the China-U.S. relationship with Joe Biden and Xi Jinping set to meet virtually on Monday.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nStill, tech-focused stocks have a way to go to recover this year’s rout. Alibaba and Baidu Inc. are by far the worst performers on the NYFANG+ Index, both sliding more than 20%, compared with a 24% jump of the elite tech index. Both trade at a more than 30% discount to average analyst price targets, implying that a rally is expected over the next 12 months.\\n\\nCloud Surge\\n\\nAway from China, a corner of the tech industry that was one of the biggest lockdown-era winners is surging on the way out of it.\\n\\nCloud-computing software maker Cloudfare Inc., which helps keep websites secure and load faster, has surged nearly 160% this year -- more than six times the gain of the Nasdaq 100. Datadog Inc., another software maker, has seen its stock almost double as its industry’s gains seem poised to continue even as the pandemic draws nearer to an end.\\n\\nThe two are among a group of companies that are thriving as workloads continue to migrate from in-house data centers to the cloud as more employees work from home. The surging stocks are in stark contrast to last year’s big winners like Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Peloton Interactive Inc. whose shares have tumbled this year as growth slows.\\n\\nWhile supply chain problems and rising inflation have dominated headlines this earnings season, cloud businesses have been among the standout winners. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. were both buoyed by their cloud divisions, whose growth outpaced many of their other businesses in the quarter ended in September.\\n\\n“It’s a mega trend,” said Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital. “I don’t know how you couldn’t be bullish about it.”\\n\\nAnd their steep rallies may have more room to run. Analyst targets project that Cloudflare and Datadog could gain another 15% and 9.7%, respectively, over the next 12 months.\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nKey iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. posted earnings that topped analysts’ estimates on strong demand for fresh versions of the Apple Inc. handset, but warned that sales will decline this quarter because of persistent chip shortages. Lordstown Motors shares plummeted 12% in postmarket trading after the electric vehicle startup said commercial production and deliveries of its Endurance pickup will begin in the third quarter of 2022, citing component and material shortages, along with other supply chain challenges. Chinese online e-commerce company JD.com said consumers placed a record 349.1 billion yuan ($54.7 billion) of orders during this year’s Singles’ Day shopping festival, fueling a 5.2% share-price gain in Hong Kong. Alibaba’s Singles’ Day shopping festival posted record sales of 540.3 billion yuan, offering China’s largest e-commerce firm a much-needed boost following a year of heightened regulatory scrutiny.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nGoogle Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged Lordstown’s Auto Industry Is Coming Back.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) is an American financial technology corporation that enables the digital transfer of funds, and its business model consists of charging a transaction fee when payments are processed for vendors, auction sites, and commercial users. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a top stock in Mitch Rubin’s Q2 portfolio, with Rubin owning 71,461 shares in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) as of the end of June, via RiverPark Advisors. With a stake value of $20.83 million, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) represents 2.65% of RiverPark Advisors’ investment portfolio.\\n\\nAs of the second quarter, 143 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), with stakes worth $16.35 billion.\\n\\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), on November 8, posted its Q3 results. EPS for the period totaled $1.11, beating estimates by $0.03. Revenue for the quarter came in at $6.18, missing target revenue by -$51.91 million.\\n\\nTruist analyst Andrew Jeffrey kept a Hold rating on PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“PayPal Holdings, Inc. was among top detractors from performance. PayPal is a pure play on e-commerce and electronic payments which is driving the company’s high unit volume growth. As a digital payments company, it is helping to facilitate the shift to a cashless society. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly accelerated the adoption of e-commerce and the utilization of digital payments platforms. In our view, PayPal is currently positioned to benefit from the strength in e-commerce trends, including increasing net new active users and increased engagement per user. PayPal also has launched a service enabling its customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account. PayPal’s vision is to become a Super App that integrates payments, commerce and financial services, as well as crypto capabilities. After outperforming earlier in the year, the performance of PayPal shares weakened in the third quarter with the company facing potentially higher transaction expenses and credit losses. The higher transaction expenses are driven by a shift by consumers to the higher cost travel and entertainment categories which skew toward less profitable credit transactions.”\\n\\n9.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) watches.\\n\\nPiper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion kept a Neutral rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) as of October 28, with a $385 price target, following the significant rebranding of the tech corporation.\\n\\nAt the end of June, 266 hedge funds out of the 873 elite funds monitored by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), up from 257 in Q1.\\n\\nHere is what Polen Capital has to say about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Facebook’s stock was pressured on concerns about regulation in the quarter. We are constantly monitoring the potential regulatory risks to Facebook (and all of our holdings). At this point, we see very little chance that regulation changes Facebook’s business model in a meaningful and adverse way. Regarding the recent data shared by a former Facebook employee and the company itself on some of the unfortunate negative consequences of social media, we recognize these types of issues will inevitably linger in different forms and fashions well into the future. We have been focused on the ability of Facebook to identify and mitigate these negative consequences while amplifying the value users typically cite for its apps across a long list of use cases. We continuously monitor the vibrance of the user base on Facebook’s apps to confirm that value.”\\n\\n8. Pinterest, Inc.

(NYSE:PINS) on November 8, but lowered the price target from $74 to $60, owing to the Q3 results and lower user traffic.\\n\\nAs of June this year, 63 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey’s elite funds were long Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), down from 83 in the preceding quarter.\\n\\nHere is what Carillon Tower Advisers has to say about Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Pinterest operates a pinboard-style social media website that enables users to create theme-based image collections for events, hobbies, and other personal interests. Despite a quarterly report that displayed solid revenue and profitability versus expectations, the stock was pressured as user engagement metrics decreased as the world reopened post-pandemic. We believe the company can continue to drive growth in the face of this headwind by increasing the number of advertisers, adding engaging video content, and ramping ecommerce capabilities.”\\n\\n7.

(NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) is a notable stock in Mitch Rubin’s Q2 portfolio.\\n\\nHere is what Polen Capital has to say about Zoetis Inc.

This is compared to 57 funds in the preceding quarter, with an approximate stake value of $3.09 billion.\\n\\nHere is what Miller Value Partners has to say about Farfetch Limited (NYSE:FTCH) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“We do still see some higher growth companies with reasonable expectations. Farfetch is a good example. Most high growth darlings trade at much higher valuations than they have historically. This isn’t true of Farfetch, which trades inline with Amazon’s historical valuation, which is a good comparable due to business model similarities. Both companies have commerce marketplaces (though Farfetch’s is high margin and Amazon’s is high asset turns) and technology services businesses. Amazon’s web services (AWS) is now well recognized. Similarly, Farfetch’s strategy is to build the operating system for luxury goods companies who have been notoriously bad at technology. The market doesn’t yet reflect any value for this business, in our opinion.\\n\\nFarfetch sold-off dramatically, recently trading at less than half its peak earlier this year. Fundamentals have performed strongly. The company has been able to maintain high growth on the top of difficult comps from last year, and recently reached adjusted EBITDA breakeven.\\n\\nWe think the company will continue to drive both growth and incremental profits over the coming years. The company’s nascent platform services and advertising businesses represent sizable opportunities. Cost rationalization in shipping and logistics should create efficiencies. People who focus on Farfetch's historical losses don’t properly distinguish between investments and operating losses (a common problem in a world of intangible assets). We believe Farfetch has the potential to be a multi-bagger over a multi-year period.\\n\\nLong duration assets like Farfetch are more sensitive to movements in interest rates. We evaluate all our investments for adequate upside even with higher interest rates. Yet rising rates does represent a legitimate risk. Warren Buffett equated interest rates to gravity for financial assets.\\n\\n3. Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)\\n\\nKuvari Partners’ Stake Value: $59,099,000\\n\\nPercentage of Kuvari Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 23.15%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 94\\n\\nSquare, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is primarily a financial services company that helps small, mid-cap, and enterprise level customers procure necessary funding for operations, in addition to offering financial products and services including point of sale systems, credit cards, payment processing, and payroll assistance, among other related services. Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a popular stock among the smart money, with 94 hedge funds owning stakes in the company, according to the database of 873 elite hedge funds maintained by Insider Monkey as of June this year.\\n\\nRepresenting 23.15% of Kuvari Partners’ Q2 portfolio, Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is indeed a top stock pick of Vikram Kumar, who recently purchased shares in the financial technology company. Q3 results on November 5 reveal an EPS for the period totaling $0.37, missing estimates by -$0.02.\\n\\nMayank Tandon, a Needham analyst, as of November 5, kept a Buy rating on Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), but lowered the price target from $350 to $315, owing to the Q3 performance. He believes that Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is positioned for robust growth in the future, once the businesses it serves gain their momentum post COVID-19.\\n\\nHere is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“We established a position in leading Financial Technology provider Square during the quarter. Through one integrated system, SQ is a hybrid of two businesses: its Seller Business (charging small and medium-sized businesses about 3% for transaction payment processing, plus other services such as instant funds access, and software for everything from customer engagement to payroll), and its Cash App (originally for person-to-person cash transfers and now a growing digital financial services provider for consumers).\\n\\nThe combined business has grown gross profit at a 37% CAGR over the past five years to $2.7 billion (due to pass through costs, gross profit is more reflective of top-line growth) and we believe that the company has an enormous long-term runway, as it has less than a 2% share of a more than $160 billion market. It is our view that the company’s Cash App (which has grown from nothing in 2015 to $1.2 billion gross profit last year) has a particularly large opportunity with its powerful ecosystem of digital financial services including digital wallets, direct deposits, stock trading, bitcoin trading, and business and tax services, which are all relatively new. The vast majority of Cash App’s more than 36 million users are younger and, importantly, are willing to replace their bank and other financial services accounts with the app.\\n\\nWe estimate that the company can grow its gross profit more than 30% and EBITDA more than 50% annually for the foreseeable future, and while most of the company’s current profit is from its Seller Business, we believe most of Square’s future value will be from its Cash App business.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 2 Stock Picks of Vikram Kumar's Kuvari Partners.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n10 Stocks to Buy According to Bluegrass Capital Partners Billionaire Stephen Mandel's Top 10 Stock Picks Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Jeff Ubben's ValueAct Capital\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

Check it out below:\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nMake sure to bookmark the new site on your browser: investorplace.com/tradingopportunities. As our team tinkers with the site, you can expect new features along the way.\\n\\nNow, here’s what we wanted to talk about for this week:\\n\\nIf history is our guide, then last week’s volatility will likely reemerge this week, but it will also be setting up some of the best buying opportunities in retail and technology stocks than we have seen in two months.\\n\\nThe market survived more record inflation reports last week, with minimal losses. However, the S&P 500 was down -0.31% for the week, breaking a six-week bullish streak.\\n\\nShould you worry? A little, but don’t forget that stocks are an “inflating asset,” so as long as earnings growth is positive (which it is), then the market is one of the best ways to profit from inflation erosion.\\n\\n30-Year Wall Street Vet: Media Ignoring This 5G Investment\\n\\nSo, let’s consider what to do: In our 20+ years in the market, the one thing we’ve learned is that a short break in a bull market is a good thing, not a bad one. Investors continually overprice short-term risks to the market and overeat.\\n\\nAny selling this week is likely to be temporary, and we think investors will have a chance to buy back in at a discount once volatility calms down.\\n\\nConsidering all of these factors, we like the following stocks:\\n\\nThe Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO): This is as steady-Eddie of a stock as you can get. Lows in the $52 to $53 range should be seen as entry points. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE): If prices drop back to $640 or less, we like that for new entries. Investors perpetually undervalue ADBE’s dominant position in subscription software and services. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT): We doubt this one will pull back very far, but investors can take advantage of increased business spending and cloud computing by looking for entries under $330 per share.\\n\\nRetail Sales\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe don’t want to run the risk of confusing anecdotes for data, but I (John) had an interesting experience this weekend. Responsible for entertaining my two-year-old grandson on Saturday afternoon, I stopped by Target to do some grocery shopping and let him run wild in the toy aisle.\\n\\nIn between wrestling boxes of Legos and new He-Man toys out of his mouth, I noticed how crowded the store was. If my store was representative of the country, then this is a good thing.\\n\\nThe negative was how many shelves were still empty. It seems like shoppers are hitting the stores early, but are goods being shipped fast enough to meet demand? That is an important question we will be looking at this week.\\n\\nStock Picking Legends Name Their Favorite 5G Plays\\n\\nTomorrow, the retail sales report will be released (which once again has a “core” number that is usually the one in the headlines). If there are shoppers but no goods, we may not be as far past the peak of the supply chain problems as we think.\\n\\nFor now, we are still optimistic. Anything over a 1% increase compared to last month would be a big win for the market and retail stocks. If that happens, we like the odds for Target Co. (NYSE:TGT) to break its all-time highs and head towards $280 a share.\\n\\nCostco Wholesale Co. (NASDAQ:COST) also looks good for a breakout, but we are warier of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and the deep discount retailers like Dollar General Co. (NYSE:DG) as they are less well-positioned to take advantage of higher cost / higher-margin electronics and home furnishings.\\n\\nA Radical New Way to Make $1,375 or More Upfront\\n\\nEarnings\\n\\nWe were right about our forecast for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B)’s earnings last week and it proves our point about avoiding the insurance sector for a while. The last few earnings reports for the quarter are trickling in this week and next, but this is still an important week.\\n\\nThe Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s Cos. Inc. (NYSE:LOW) will both be reporting on the 16th and 17th. Along with Walmart’s earnings and the retail sales report from the Census Bureau on the 16th, the home improvement stores will tell us a lot about consumer spending and home sales. Ross Stores Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) will also report on the 18th after the market closes, but the home improvement stores are a more important bellwether for consumer behavior. Bitcoin has been doing very well lately, which is usually a plus for NVIDIA Co. (NASDAQ:NVDA). Earnings on the 17th after the market closes could be a useful gauge for tech stocks, but NVDA tends to be an outlier so we shouldn’t put too much weight on its data alone.\\n\\nSocial Media Tiffs, Conferences, and Potential Market Swings\\n\\nA bizarre Twitter fight took place this past weekend between Elon Musk and Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont. At one point Elon threatened Sanders with “Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word…”\\n\\nIt’s unclear to us why Elon selling stock in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) would be a problem for Bernie. Yelling at an 80-year-old democratic socialist on Twitter that you are going to punch yourself in the face (financially speaking) unless he leaves you alone seems pointless, but it could be a problem for the market. As mentioned last week, volatility in TSLA’s stock is an issue for the major indexes because it is such a large component.\\n\\nGuaranteed Instant $$$ Payout — No Matter What\\n\\nSpeaking of pointless statements, on Wednesday, no fewer than six voting members of the Fed’s board of governors will give speeches at various think tanks, roundtables, online discussions, and other I-can’t-believe-anyone-gets-paid-to-attend-these conferences.\\n\\nThese are usually non-events with very generic comments, but this time, there’s an even split between the more dovish (lower interest rates are good) and hawkish (inflation is bad and rates should go up) members sermonizing, and the stakes around interest rates and inflation are getting higher.\\n\\nThe odds that we hear stronger (or at least more specific) language from the governors on Wednesday is higher than normal and could trigger some wide swings in the market. Unless you have an urgent need to make some changes in your portfolio, it might make sense to wait until earnings, retail sales, and the flock of Fed governors are in the rear-view mirror on Thursday.\\n\\nWe’ll be back with you on Friday.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJohn Jagerson & Wade Hansen\\r\\n Editors, Trading Opportunities\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nStock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Now Man Who Called Black Monday: “Prepare Now.” #1 EV Stock Still Flying Under the Radar Interested in Crypto?

       " \"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best blue chip dividend stocks. To skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks.\\n\\nAlthough no stock can ensure complete stability, blue chip stocks are among the few that can offer investors the closest best alternative. According to Forbes, these stocks have five main markers: longevity, reliability, market capitalization, name recognition, and perhaps most importantly, dividends. Because of their past performance demonstrating survival through recessions and market downturns, and smooth records of good earnings, blue chip stocks are generally considered reliable investments.\\n\\nTrack records of some blue chip stocks can cement the above points. For instance, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had a 10-year trailing return of 29.48% this November, and the company also made dividend payments to its shareholders of $0.56 per share just this August. If you take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), we see a 10-year trailing return of 27% and dividend payments of $0.22 per share as of this November. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), has a 10-year trailing return of 13.61% as of this November and paid $1.06 per share in dividends up till this August.\\n\\nThe list will go on the longer we look into blue chip dividend stocks, but the point remains the same: these stocks, like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), are among the best investment options for those seeking income and stability. As such, we have seen this year a growing interest in blue chip stocks, as mentioned by Bloomberg. Retail day traders have been noted to be piling into these stocks as of this April, with analysts from JPMorgan and VandaTrack using this trend to explain the decreasing popularity of small-cap stocks. As of this April, the S&P's large-cap benchmark has risen nearly 4% from the March 12 record, while the S&P 600 small-cap index fell almost 5%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nInvesting has become difficult by the day, even for the smart money. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and July 2021, our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 186.1%, vs. 100.1% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 86 percentage points (see the details here).

It continues to experience business momentum through several dominant, essential, and competitively advantaged businesses, like Office 365 and Azure. The markets it competes for are enormous, which gives the company the ability to compound at scale. In the past quarter alone, the company generated over $40 billion in revenue, representing a 17% growth rate. The inherent operating leverage in Microsoft’s business model continues and led to 34% earnings growth this past quarter. Despite the broad rotation we saw in the first quarter and Microsoft’s robust performance in 2020, we think its business fundamentals continue to exhibit strength, and the stock continues to reflect the fundamentals.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks To Invest In According To Stephen Errico's Locust Wood Capital.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n12 Best Warehouse and Self Storage Stocks to Buy 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Now 11 Best Hotel Stocks To Invest In\\n\\nDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks To Invest In According To Stephen Errico's Locust Wood Capital is originally published on Insider Monkey.\",\n",
       " 'For Immediate Release\\n\\nChicago, IL – November 15, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Sony Group Corporation SONY, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Nintendo Co. Ltd. NTDOY.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\nWill the PS5 Supply Chain Be a Boon to Sony Competitors?\\n\\nAs\\xa0Sony Group observes the first anniversary of its PlayStation 5 (PS5) gaming console today, the celebrations are likely to be muted. Despite scripting a blockbuster market entry with products flying off shelves and selling 10 million units within July to become the fastest Sony console to reach the tally, it has since fallen behind its predecessor PS4 owing to the dearth of essential components.\\n\\nTo add to the woes, management has reportedly reduced the PS5 production outlook for the current fiscal by 1 million to 15 million due to supply chain disruptions, severely denting its holiday season sales. This is likely to offer an opportunity to rival gaming consoles like\\xa0Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Nintendo’s Switch to poach on prospective buyers or those sitting on the fence, although the global shortage of semiconductor chips is expected to affect their production schedule as well.\\n\\nWhat Ails Sony?\\n\\nSony had previously targeted production of more than 16 million PS5 units for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2022. However, the company has been saddled with various logistics issues and a shortage of vital components, making it hard to have a steady supply throughout the year.\\n\\nMoreover, uneven coronavirus vaccine rollouts across developing nations from where it procures the bulk of its raw materials have made the supplies highly unpredictable and irregular, affecting the regular production schedule. The manufacturing snag has dealt a blow to the Japan-based conglomerate as it aimed to capitalize on the uptick in pandemic-induced nesting activities — games, streaming video, and home fitness. This, in turn, has left the door ajar for its rivals to score big in the imminent holiday season, with their gaming consoles up and running.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFeatures Loaded\\n\\nNot all is lost for Sony though, as it has loaded the product with updated graphics, a newly-redesigned controller, and a collection of exclusive games. With a powerful 8-core AMD Zen 2 processor, 10.3 teraflops of graphics power, gorgeous 4K visuals, and an immersive end-user experience, the PS5 promises one of the best performances witnessed in a gaming console. Moreover, PS5 loads games about 10 to 20 seconds faster than the PS4 Pro and can even read physical discs a few minutes faster, making it an ideal choice for tech-savvy gamers.\\n\\nHow Are Rivals Faring?\\n\\nAlthough Microsoft initially faced certain supply chain issues for its Xbox Series X, it is likely to have avoided the pitfalls for a steady supply of products during the holiday season. Moreover, Microsoft has several games up its sleeves for release to cash in on the frenzy, namely\\xa0Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, and Age of Empires 4 while Sony does not have any notable first-party games for the upcoming holiday release.\\n\\nDuring first-quarter fiscal 2022, Microsoft’s gaming revenues increased 16% year over year, driven by higher engagement levels. Revenues from Xbox hardware surged 166%, driven by strong demand for new consoles. For second-quarter fiscal 2022, Microsoft expects gaming revenues to be up in the high single digits on solid demand for the next generation Xbox Series X and S gaming consoles.\\n\\nNintendo is grappling with supply chain disruptions and global chip shortages, forcing it to trim its sales forecast for 2021 by 6% to 24 million units. Similar to Sony, it acknowledged that it would face a tough time meeting the surge in demand during the holiday season. Nintendo has particularly flourished during the pandemic with its social simulation game titled\\xa0Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but a dearth of such blockbuster games in the current season is likely to hit sales.\\n\\nAlthough Nintendo recently launched the Switch OLED model, which is arguably one of its best models produced so far, it is unlikely to translate into a huge success. Moreover, early data reveal that most buyers are likely upgraders rather than new customers, which reduces the incremental earning potential from software sales.\\n\\nCatch Up Game: Quick Fixes\\n\\nIn order to bridge the demand-supply gap, Sony is resorting to some unconventional quick fixes as it expedited PS5 shipments to the United Kingdom through three chartered flights out of South Korea. About 12 articulated lorries were required to ferry the gaming consoles from the airport’s cargo hub to the various U.K. distribution centers and retail stores to cater to the huge Christmas demand.\\n\\nWill these short-term measures suffice? We leave that for the Gamers to decide.\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\nsupport@zacks.com\\n\\nhttps://www.zacks.com\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Nothing has helped.\\n\\n7 Stocks to Buy With Stacks of Free Cash Flow\\n\\nThe reason? While IBM had the cash flow to sustain cloud investment, it prioritized buybacks and dividends under former CEO, now executive chairman, Virginia Rometty. The company paid out nearly $5.8 billion in dividends in 2020 and put just $3.2 billion into capital expenditures.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBrain Drain\\n\\nThe result is that, while Red Hat is being marketed as the company’s growth engine, it’s being forced to hire junior programmers for senior positions. While Rometty continues to be lauded as a business leader, the company she ran is circling the drain.\\n\\nUnder current IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM has more employees in India than in the U.S., and every move it makes comes with financial pain. Krishna said the Kyndryl spin-off caused a “pause” in client spending. While the rest of tech is in growth mode, IBM revenue for the September quarter was flat, and cloud revenue was up just 14%. IBM’s brain trust has been systematically decapitated. Whether it wins or loses the resulting age discrimination lawsuit is irrelevant.\\n\\nInstead of addressing its weaknesses, IBM just reshuffles the deck chairs on this Titanic. Its Global Business Services unit is now called IBM Consulting. It keeps claiming “ambitious, long-term strategies” and reporters keep calling it a “tech giant,” but the fact is it’s irrelevant.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on IBM Stock\\n\\nIBM is now the Grey Gardens of the computing industry. It’s a huge technology mansion, filled with empty rooms. It’s a huge bureaucracy, pretending at being what it’s most definitely not, a major technology player.\\n\\nThere are still analysts predicting great things for IBM. The average one-year price target at Tipranks is 30% above where it’s now trading. But this is a stock that’s up just 6.65% in a year where the average stock in the S&P 500 is up 32%. It’s down 8% in the last two years, 22% in the last five years, even as the tech sector has come to dominate the world economy.\\n\\nIf there’s a Mt. Rushmore for short-sighted management, Virginia Rometty is its George Washington.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in MSFT, AAPL and AMZN.

       " \"For the last several years, tech stocks have been one of the favorite targets of the market alarmists. In 2021, we’ve already had a couple of hard selloffs in technology stocks.\\n\\nIn the most bullish of bull markets, investors still get those articles forecasting that the end is nigh. It seems permabears can always find some reason to believe the market is going to crash. And truthfully they only have to be right once for your portfolio to be in a world of hurt.\\n\\nBut this is not one of those articles. The market is volatile, but market timing is a fool’s errand.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nHowever, you have to be a next-level optimist if you don’t have any concerns about what’s happening with the economy. And once you acknowledge those concerns, it doesn’t take much to consider how that could affect the broader market and more narrowly the stocks in your portfolio.\\n\\nThis concern brings us to this article’s focus on tech stocks. This is a resilient sector that continues to reward growth-oriented investors. But that doesn’t mean all tech stocks are the same. (Have a look at Eric Fry’s latest Smart Money newsletter for his take on tech stocks driving critical trends into 2022.)\\n\\nAnd, of course, there are some stocks that are more prone to those gut-wrenching drops than others. The ones that don’t are the ones that you should watch.\\n\\n7 Stocks to Buy With Stacks of Free Cash Flow\\n\\nThat’s the focus of this article. Using the stock’s 2021 performance along with analyst sentiment, here are seven tech stocks that are likely to resist any market selloff.\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ON Semicoductor (NASDAQ:ON) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) RingCentral (NYSE:RNG)\\n\\nTech Stocks To Resist Any Market Selloff: Microsoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\\n\\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI was trying to stay away from “big tech” companies, but it’s difficult to not include Microsoft on this list of tech stocks. Recently, Microsoft overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the world’s most valuable company.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe company was a pandemic winner with its Teams collaboration software. But the company has continued to thrive even as the economy reopens. That’s largely due to the growth in its cloud computing business.\\n\\nAnd as Dana Blankenhorn wrote for InvestorPlace, Microsoft is also angling to become a leader in the developing metaverse via a partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In short, the company has many catalysts and its most recent earnings report showed that it is firing on all cylinders.\\n\\nMicrosoft delivered a strong earnings report in October. Subsequently, analysts continue to raise their price target for the stock which is already up 48.7% in 2021. And if investors needed one more reason to believe MSFT stock will weather any selloff, they can look at the company’s quarterly dividend which has increased for the last 12 years and now pays out $2.24 per year.\\n\\nON Semiconductor (ON) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nFew things predict stock price growth as positive earnings. ON Semiconductor just delivered its sixth-consecutive quarter in which it beat analysts’ earnings expectations.\\n\\nSince that Oct. 31 report , over a dozen analysts have increased their price target for ON stock. The combination of positive earnings and analyst upgrades is always a bullish indicator.\\n\\nAn earnings report tells you the “what.” Equally important is the “why.” In the case of ON Semiconductor it is a significant supplier for electric vehicles (EVs). Specifically the Arizona-based company’s custom foundry business provides image sensors and power semiconductors. Both of these chips will remain in high demand as manufacturers begin to roll-out these vehicles.\\n\\n7 Best Cryptocurrencies That Could Hit New Highs Soon\\n\\nThe company also has significant exposure to the ongoing 5G rollout and the Internet of Things (IoT) sector.\\n\\nThe stock did go through a sharp selloff in April, but otherwise ON stock has been a stellar performer that is up 76% in 2021.\\n\\nTech Stocks To Resist Any Market Selloff: Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\\n\\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAnother semiconductor company that makes my list of tech stocks that are likely to survive a market selloff is Broadcom. AVGO stock is up over 25% in 2021 (26.5% as of this writing).\\n\\nThe company provides chips for data centers as well as for the networking, software, and industrial markets.\\n\\nBroadcom has beaten on the top and bottom lines for the last five consecutive quarters. And it has strong, growing free cash flow (FCF) that topped $3.43 billion in the last quarter, an 11% quarterly increase. Plus, investors can enjoy an attractive dividend which has grown for 10 consecutive years with a three-year growth rate of 177.75%.\\n\\nThe company is trading at the upper end of is 52-week range and is bumping up against the consensus price of analysts. However, the company recently received two bullish upgrades and is scheduled to report earnings in early December. Another strong report should bring more optimistic analyst sentiment and a likely higher price for AVGO stock.\\n\\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials company sign outside office\\n\\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI won’t even begin to say I understand the ins and outs of quantum computing. But I know this much. It may be one of the must-own sectors of the next decade. According to Quince Market Insights, the global quantum computing market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.4% between 2021 and 2030.\\n\\nIf that comes to pass, companies will need faster, more powerful semiconductors, which is the bullish narrative for Applied Materials. The company is a key supplier to the semiconductor industry and recently introduced its eBeam metrology system which provides patterning control over logic and memory chips.\\n\\n7 Stocks to Buy With Stacks of Free Cash Flow\\n\\nInvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek described the company’s position well when he wrote, “In a gold rush, you want to be the person selling shovels. Applied Materials should be one of those for the quantum computing industry.”\\n\\nAMAT stock is bumping up against its 52-week high. However, the stock has climbed approximately 20% in the last month. And an earnings report in mid-November could be a catalyst that moves the stock higher.\\n\\nTech Stocks To Resist Any Market Selloff: PayPal (PYPL) PayPal (PYPL) logo overlays daylight photo of corporate building\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nYou may be wondering how I can include PayPal on a list of tech stocks that should resist a selloff. PYPL stock itself has dropped nearly 25% in less than a month. The reason I can is because of my conviction that this is a case of a correction that has gone too far.\\n\\nYes, the fintech company didn’t wow investors with its latest earnings report. And investors didn’t like the speculation that the company was looking into buying Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). But right now, investors are selling the news pretty hard.\\n\\nSince the company reported earnings the analyst community has been bearish with approximately 20 analysts lowering their price target for PYPL stock. But many of these lower price targets are still higher than the consensus price target of $288 and are significantly higher than the stock price as of this writing which is $204.37.\\n\\nIt’s possible that a broader market selloff could send PYPL stock lower. However, in volatile times, investors usually seek out quality stocks and the fundamentals of PayPal will eventually remind investors of why they liked it in the first place. And now they can get the stock on sale.\\n\\nCirrus Logic (CRUS) The Cirrus Logic (CRUS) logo on a phone in someone's jeans pocket.\\n\\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nCirrus Logic stock is down 5% for the year. However, analysts look ahead, not behind. So when the consensus opinion of analysts is that a stock price may increase 33% over the next 12 months, that’s something investors will want to take note of. That’s the case with CRUS stock.\\n\\nThe semiconductor company provides integrated circuits for portable audio products and non-portable audio and other products. This is a category that includes smartphones. Strong demand for these products is driving the company’s revenue and earnings.\\n\\n7 Best Cryptocurrencies That Could Hit New Highs Soon\\n\\nOn a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 34% and earnings were up 44%. Since the earnings report, two analysts have reiterated their ratings and one gave the stock a $114 price target which is nearly 10% higher than the consensus target of $105.\\n\\nTech Stocks To Resist Any Market Selloff: RingCentral (RNG) The RingCentral (RNG) mobile app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\\n\\nSource: OpturaDesign/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAlong the same lines as Cirrus Logic, RingCentral is another darling of the analyst community. The company just delivered an earnings report that showed the developer of cloud communication solutions continues to thrive.\\n\\nEarnings of 36 cents per share blew away the estimate for negative earnings per share of 59 cents and were 38.5% higher on a YOY basis. The same was true of revenue which came in at $414.6 million, a 36.6% YOY increase.\\n\\nSince the earnings report, four analysts have raised their price target for RNG stock. Another analyst reiterated their buy rating. And the single analyst that reduced their price target still has the stock trading higher than the consensus price target.\\n\\nRNG stock is trading significantly below is 52-week high. The stock sold off sharply at the beginning of the year as investors anticipated that remote workers would soon be returning to the office. That still hasn’t materialized as expected, and as investors see that it’s become a catalyst for the stock.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Photo: Tyrone Siu/Reuters\\n\\nAt first mention, you may think the metaverse sounds like a fantasy world in the latest futuristic Hollywood blockbuster, and truth be told you are not wrong.\\n\\nThe term was first coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash, in which he described a virtual reality-based successor to the internet.\\n\\nA few decades later, the 2011 dystopian science fiction novel Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline, also centred around a metaverse called the OASIS, which is accessed with a virtual reality headset and wired gloves to escape a world crumbling by an energy crisis.\\n\\nFast forward to today, and the metaverse is now a hot buzzword in Silicon Valley. It is also tied to the development of Web 3.0, which some believe will be the next chapter of the internet’s existence.\\n\\nSo what is the metaverse?\\n\\nThe metaverse is an extensive online world in which people are able to interact via digital avatars.\\n\\nIt is a hypothesised 3D environment, through personal computing, smartphones, and virtual augmented reality headsets, combining both virtual and physical spaces. It also implements social media elements such as avatar identity, and content creation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Web 3.0, also known as the decentralised web, is the latest generation of internet applications and services, powered by distributed ledger technology, the most common being blockchains.\\n\\nIt focuses on connecting data in a decentralised way, rather than having it stored centrally, with computers able to interpret information as intelligently as humans.\\n\\nWatch: YouTube expands its market and Facebook goes Meta\\n\\nSectors\\n\\nSo far, a number of companies have announced plans to develop metaverse experiences, services and hardware, particularly social media firms and gaming companies.\\n\\nSimilar experiences already exist in the gaming world, such as Pokemon Go which is played on mobile phones. Epic Games’ Fortnite, and Roblox (RBLX), have both similar technologies and have previously hosted virtual concerts with artists such as Ariana Grande, Travis Scott and Lil Nas.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMetaverse companies are also looking at hosting sporting events for thousands of people simultaneously.\\n\\nSome organisations are also looking to expand metaverse spaces to businesses, in which people can attend and participate in work meetings, or shop online and try on clothing digitally.\\n\\nRead more: Non-fungible tokens: What are NFTs and why are they creating such a stir?\\n\\nIt is also set to play a big part in education to allow a more focused learning environment for schools and universities.\\n\\nVirtual reality has long been used in the real estate sector for home tours, and metaverse development may also expand that function.

The metaverse was also the driver behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR which helped it to launch a meeting software for companies, called Horizon Workrooms.\\n\\nWatch: Trademark applicants of ‘Meta’ are reportedly open to selling to Zuckerberg for $20 million\\n\\n“A lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another,” Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nElsewhere, Microsoft (MSFT), Unity Software (U), and Nvidia (NVDA) are among the companies developing hardware and software for the metaverse.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Disney (DIS) chief executive Bob Chapek also said the company was set to also leap into the realms virtual reality.\\n\\nHe said: “The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience.”\\n\\n“Our efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we’ll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse.”\\n\\nRead more: Disney misses in Q4, streaming growth decelerates\\n\\nDating platform Bumble (BMBL) said this week it was exploring how to integrate the metaverse and Web 3.0 into a relaunch of its platform.\\n\\n“We've got a couple of tests that we're very excited about that we will be rolling out in the upcoming months around this, but we think that's the first toehold there,” Bumble president Tariq Shaukat said.\\n\\n“This is something that is going to evolve. We want to make sure we're setting the technical and engineering foundation for whatever emerges in the metaverse and in the Web 3.0 world.”\\n\\nCriticisms\\n\\nThe concept of the metaverse is not without its critics, who have accused it of being “over-hyped” and based on existing technology.\\n\\nSome of the more worrying concerns centre around privacy information, data protection and user addiction. Mental health is often a huge topic around online gaming, with some users preferring the virtual world over the real world, and struggling with engaging socially, as well as neglecting real-life needs.\\n\\nThe other implication is cost. Facebook has already announced a $50m (£36m) investment programme to ensure the metaverse is built “responsibly”, but it has spent billions of dollars a year already.\\n\\nInvestors currently seem to be playing a wait-and-see game to see which young startups are worth backing as the expansion of the metaverse unfolds.\\n\\nWatch: Trapped in the Metaverse: Here’s What 24 Hours Feels Like\",\n",

He will join Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, whom Biden named to run that agency in June, as the face of competition enforcement in the U.S.\\n\\nThe same month he nominated Kanter, Biden announced a government-wide effort to encourage competition across industries. He faulted increased consolidation for rising prices and lower wages for workers and pitched his competition agenda as a way to bolster economic growth and innovation.\\n\\nKanter will take over at the Justice Department as it presses forward with a monopoly lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google filed during the Trump administration.

       " \"(Bloomberg) -- China is accelerating plans to replace American and foreign technology, quietly empowering a secretive government-backed organization to vet and approve local suppliers in sensitive areas from cloud to semiconductors, people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAmazon Sued Over Crashes by Drivers Rushing to Make Deliveries What Designers of Video Game Cities Understand About Real Cities Biden Plan Funds New Bridges That Locals May Not Want Hong Kong's New Museum Tries to Please Art World — and Beijing Chronically Underfunded HBCUs Eye Scholarships in Biden Bill\\n\\nFormed in 2016 to advise the government, the Information Technology Application Innovation Working Committee has now been entrusted by Beijing to help set industry standards and train personnel to operate trusted software. The quasi-government body will devise and execute the so-called “IT Application Innovation” plan, better known as Xinchuang in Chinese. It will choose from a basket of suppliers vetted under the plan to provide technology for sensitive sectors from banking to data centers storing government data, a market that could be worth $125 billion by 2025.\\n\\nSo far, 1,800 Chinese suppliers of PCs, chips, networking and software have been invited to join the committee, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The organization has so far certified hundreds of local companies this year as committee members, the fastest pace in years, one of the people said.\\n\\nThe existence of the Xinchuang white-list, whose members and over-arching goals haven’t been previously reported, is likely to inflame tensions just as Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping wrapped up their first face-to-face virtual summit. It gives Beijing more leverage to replace foreign tech firms in sensitive sectors and quickens a push to help local champions achieve tech self-sufficiency and overcome sanctions first imposed by the Trump administration in fields like networking and chips.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“China is trying to develop homegrown technologies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. “This effort is more serious now that many more domestic firms now share that political goal, since no one can be sure that U.S. technologies can avoid U.S. export controls.”\\n\\nRead more: Huawei Recruits Smartphone Partners to Sidestep U.S. Sanctions\\n\\nThe push to replace foreign suppliers is part of a broader effort by Beijing to exert control over its sprawling technology industry, including over data security. Already, the government has forced overseas cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp. to set up joint ventures to operate on the mainland. Apple Inc. has also yielded its user data storage business to a government-backed operator in Guizhou. The grip is set to tighten, as the tech industry ministry gains more oversight of industrial and telecom data and proposes new rules that will require crucial data to be stored inside the country.\\n\\nWhile few details have been revealed about the Xinchuang committee or its members, any companies that are more than 25% foreign-owned will be excluded from the panel, shutting out overseas suppliers including Intel Corp. and Microsoft. Chinese tech startups that are primarily funded by foreign investment will also face a higher bar, though Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the country’s two largest providers of cloud services, have managed to circumvent those rules by applying for membership through locally incorporated subsidiaries, the people said.\\n\\n“U.S. choke-hold policies, exemplified by the Entity List, were the direct catalyst that pushed China to build the Xinchuang sector,” Shanghai-based research firm iResearch said in a report in July. “The blacklisting underlined the urgency for China to invest more in technology innovation and have the key technologies made in China.”\\n\\nBlacklists, Trade and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTake\\n\\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the China Electronics Standardization Association, which oversees the committee, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Alibaba representatives didn’t immediately respond to a written request seeking comment. A Tencent spokesperson declined to comment.\\n\\nThe committee had 1,160 members in July 2020, according to Netis, a cloud company that claimed it passed a complex review process. Other prominent companies include Beijing-based CPU maker Loongson, server maker Inspur and operating systems developer Standard Software. Westone, an information security company that could potentially be tasked by Beijing to take over Didi Global Inc.’s data management, is also a member.\\n\\nMembership on the panel could give local suppliers a key advantage in having their technology approved under the Xinchuang plan, thus unlocking a billion-dollar market. Xinchuang-related business generated 162 billion yuan ($25 billion) in sales last year and is on track to reach nearly 800 billion yuan by 2025, according to a report co-authored by the China Software Industry Association.\\n\\n“In every sector of the Xinchuang industry, there’s a significant imbalance between supply and demand,” it said. “Suppliers need to press the gas pedal to the floor in order to meet the demand.”\\n\\nIn September, the Xinhua-backed Economic Information Daily newspaper listed 40 top performers of the Xinchuang project, which included Huawei Technologies Co., Alibaba’s cloud unit and network security company Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc. In an April list of 70 model cases in the Xinchuang industry, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology praised Alibaba’s “100% self-developed” cloud platform for “providing a safe, trustworthy digital infrastructure for all levels of governments.”\\n\\nCommunist Party entities, the government and military will be the first to adopt Xinchuang products, followed by financial and state-owned companies, according to iResearch.\\n\\n“Xinchuang can’t be built in one day, it’s a long-term strategy that helps China grow its own IT technologies,” the report said.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images One of the World’s Poorest Countries Found a Better Way to Do Stimulus Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",

Analysts, on average, projected Qualcomm’s sales would reach about $43.8 billion. The chipmaker’s revenue is on course to expand about 16% in its current fiscal year, 2022, before slowing to grow at 7% in the following year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon, who was promoted to the top job at the San Diego-based chipmaker earlier this year, is trying to lower Qualcomm’s dependence on smartphones and jump on higher-growth opportunities in markets such as automotive, wireless home broadband and industrial.\\n\\nThe company projected revenue from the Internet of Things, which are smart devices connected to the web, will reach $9 billion by fiscal year 2024. Chips sales for the auto industry may hit $3.5 billion in five years, Palkhiwala said.\\n\\nShares gained as much as 4.3% to $175.68 in New York, an intraday record high for the stock.\\n\\nUntil the company’s Nov. 3 earnings announcement, investors had remained skeptical. The company gave a bullish outlook and posted a strong quarterly performance, sending the stock up 13% the following day. That helped shares gain 11% for the year through Monday’s close, but the performance is still trailing a broader rally by semiconductor stocks.\\n\\nTuesday’s predictions may help gain investor acceptance for Amon’s plan for the company’s future.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn the near term, Qualcomm is having more success at combating concern that it will lose Apple Inc. as a customer as soon as the iPhone maker can develop its own modem chips. Amon has said that the majority of growth he expects in that market will come in devices built on the Android operating system. Qualcomm’s new businesses include home wireless broadband, the growing use of cellular networks to provide high-speed internet connections to homes that don’t have wired access. In cars, Qualcomm is trying to work its way into the market for self-driving vehicles with chips that connect them to wireless networks and power infotainment functions. The company is also trying to break into Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s hold on the market for computer processors with beefed-up versions of its Snapdragon chip. Microsoft Corp. is an early customer. For consumers, Qualcomm chips are appearing more in tablets, virtual-reality headsets and wearables. In industrial applications, the company’s products can be found in energy metering, warehouse logistics systems and retail point-of-sale equipment. Sales at its IoT division were up 66% to $1.54 billion last quarter.\\n\\nQualcomm’s flagship phone-chip business rose 56% to $4.69 billion in that period. Amon said he will prioritize that unit allocating supply to those more profitable chips for the time being and that will hurt IoT growth in the short term.\\n\\nLike many other chipmakers, Qualcomm outsources production to companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. A surge in demand has left these foundries unable to keep up, but there have been recent signs that chip shortages may be easing.\\n\\nThe company is unique in the industry because a large chunk of its profit comes from technology licensing.

Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (NYSE:WMC)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 12\\n\\nWestern Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (NYSE:WMC) is a real estate investment trust. The stock stands to benefit as rents across the United States surge. The company has a market cap of $148 million and was founded in 2009.\\n\\nLatest data shows that Fisher Asset Management owned 27,000 shares of Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (NYSE:WMC) at the end of the third quarter of 2021 worth $70,000 in value.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 12 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $14 million in Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (NYSE:WMC), up from 8 the preceding quarter worth $15 million.\\n\\nJust like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (NYSE:WMC) is one of the stocks attracting the attention of elite investors.\\n\\n9. Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:CPRT)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 44\\n\\nCopart, Inc. (NASDAQ:CPRT) provides vehicle marketing and online auction services. According to regulatory filings, Fisher Asset Management owned 1,522 shares in the company at the end of September 2021 worth $211,000.\\n\\nOn September 10, investment advisory Truist reiterated a Buy rating on Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:CPRT) stock and raised the price target to $160 from $145, appreciating the solid earnings beat of the firm in the fourth fiscal quarter results.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Praesidium Investment Management Company is a leading shareholder in Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:CPRT) with 992,272 shares worth more than $130 million.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, Merion Road Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:CPRT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Many of our companies reported very strong earnings back in April. The market shrugged these off as it pondered how much growth would be sustainable, are inflationary trends transitory, and when interest rates will rise. While a slow-down in the broader economic recovery would hurt our portfolio, I remain positive on our position’s market positioning and longer term trends.\\n\\nFor instance, Copart reported 33% YoY revenue growth with EBIT margins expanding to 45%, an all-time high. While the company benefitted from inflation (an interesting hedge the market largely ignored earlier in the year), sustainable increases in ASPs and service offerings bode well for revenue per vehicle growth. Management noted that traffic is still down 20% or more as non-US markets are several months behind the United States on reopening and vaccinations. This volume boost should provide good tailwinds in the coming months.”\\n\\n8. Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\\n\\nPitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI) is a technology company that markets commerce solutions. It recently announced the acquisition of Cresco Data, a Singapore-based commerce firm. The company has also signed a partnership with Kyndryl, an IT service management firm, for the implementation of a new cloud infrastructure that will help modernize operations.\\n\\nThe hedge fund of billionaire Ken Fisher owned over 1 million shares of Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI) at the end of the third quarter of 2021 worth more than $7.5 million, representing a very small portion of the total portfolio of the fund.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 23 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $126 million in Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI), up from 21 in the previous quarter worth $130 million.\\n\\nIn its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Pitney Bowes (PBI) was also a recent laggard off nearly 20% during the quarter. The company has been building out an E-commerce business for the past 10 years that is approaching $2B in revenue and growing revenues longer-term at a double digit pace. With the E-commerce segment approaching scale, management has significant new initiatives underway to help improve the segment’s profitability to normalized levels (8-12% EBIT margins) over the next couple of years. Success on achieving normalized profitability for the segment would dramatically enhance Pitney Bowes earnings (>$1 in EPS) and annual free cash flow generation (>$250M). Last quarter we highlighted, the digital service business within Pitney’s E-commerce segment and the significant embedded value that was suggested by recent acquisition of a direct competitor Stamps.com at 8x revenue. However, another recent market transaction suggests the E-commerce business has even greater embedded value. At the end of the second quarter, Global-e (GLBE), a UK company that focuses on cross-border business came public at $25/share or approx. $4B market capitalization. The initial IPO price suggested, 2021 Enterprise value to Revenue >20x. Since the IPO, GLBE has climbed to greater than $50/share. Within Pitney Bowes’s E-commerce segment there is a much larger cross border business representing approximately $500M in revenue. The current valuation of Global-e suggests Pitney’s cross border business is worth significantly more than the company’s current market cap. With the marketplace valuing many businesses in excess of 10x revenue, we believe that Pitney Bowes shares remain significantly mispriced at only .35x of revenue and >30% normalized earnings and free cash flow yield. In our opinion, the shares are becoming increasing attractive as their E-commerce segment appears to be significantly undervalued and has the potential to unlock significant equity value over the next couple of years.”\\n\\n7. Invitae Corporation (NYSE:NVTA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\\n\\nInvitae Corporation (NYSE:NVTA) is a medical genetics firm based in California. Fisher Asset Management owned 833,946 shares in the company at the end of September 2021 worth $24.7 million, representing 0.01% of the portfolio of the fund.\\n\\nCowen recently transferred the coverage of Invitae Corporation (NYSE:NVTA) stock to analyst Dan Brennan.

(NASDAQ:JD) is one of the notable stocks to invest in.\\n\\nArisaig Partners mentioned JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“JD.com, for example, continues to display impressive operating momentum, with sales on track to grow around 30% this year by our estimates. Looking longer term, this company is making a credible claim to be the dominant player in Chinese grocery ecommerce, an enormous chunk of overall consumption in China, and the last one yet to move online in a big way. We think that JD has a clear advantage over rivals here thanks to its integrated and fully self-managed logistics capabilities. Whereas an offline big box retailer might have 10-20,000 SKUs, JD offers 8 million. 90% of orders fulfilled by JD Logistics can be delivered on the same day or the next day to 500 million customers. The fact that JD has just 30 days of inventory tells us that this is a highly-optimised fulfilment chain. It is very hard to be both fast and efficient, and in order to achieve this it is necessary to know what inventory to hold in which warehouse, and when to hold it (“right place, right time, right person”), a highly information-intensive challenge. The only other retailer that comes close to being able to manage that level of complexity is Amazon, and indeed these are capabilities that are very hard to replicate, taking decades of painstaking investment, trial and error testing, and data accumulation.\\n\\nMoreover, far from being some sort of ‘victim’, this company is most likely a beneficiary of tighter regulation in this sector. A recurrent message running through JD’s recent investor day was that of “deep purpose”, the objective being to create shared value for a broader ecosystem of customers, merchants and employees. As we describe in the next section on “Navigating China”, this form of alignment with the strategic objectives of the government is a very China-specific way of conceptualising ESG, and essential for all businesses that operate in this country to get right...\" (Click here to see the full text)\\n\\n9.

Alphabet contributed to performance due to a strong quarterly report highlighted by revenue growth that beat consensus expectations across segments. The company’s core search revenues have increased 10% over the past two years, with cloud computing increasing 8%. Results from YouTube also exceeded expectations. When discussing quarterly results, Alphabet management said retail, entertainment and travel were end markets that were particularly strong. The fixed cost structure of Alphabet’s search service resulted in profitability resulting from the increase in revenues being better than expected.”\\n\\n8.

However, we believe that some of these technologies have meaningful limitations which could benefit existing payment networks. For example, BNPL transactions are often funded with cards and turn a one-time transaction into many smaller ones with more transaction fees for Mastercard. Just like with regulation, we continually monitor for competition and technological disruption. As of now, we do not see a significant risk in the foreseeable future to this company.”\\n\\n7.

Microsoft is a Positive Dynamic Change beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s enterprise cloud product, Azure, is rapidly growing and accruing market share. Microsoft reported that Azure grew 51% in the second quarter. This high unit volume growth is a primary driver of the company’s higher share price, but the company’s strong operating execution has enabled margin expansion that has also helped to increase forward earnings estimates. We believe Microsoft’s subscription-based software offerings and cloud computing services have a durable growth profile because they enhance customers’ growth initiatives and help them to diminish costs. Additionally, investors appreciate Microsoft’s strong free cash flow generation and its return of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”\\n\\n6.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“UnitedHealth Group detracted from performance due to investor concerns about Medicare premiums as well as post-COVID medical cost trends. Medicare enrollment should continue to grow at double-digits at UnitedHealthcare. Meanwhile the Company’s Optum segment should be able to help bend the cost curve if indeed post-COVID volumes pick up to above pre-COVID levels. In any case, we do not think the long-term normalized trend of medical care in the U.S. has changed substantially and would look to add to our new position on any continuing short-term concerns.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy According to Columbus Hill Capital Management.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n10 Best Large-cap Stocks To Buy Now 12 Best Large-cap Biotech Stocks To Buy Now Top 10 Large-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now\\n\\nDisclosure.

       " \"Like a puppy chasing its tail, some new investors often chase 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft\\n\\nMicrosoft's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.\\n\\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. Who among us would not applaud Microsoft's stratospheric annual EPS growth of 54%, compound, over the last three years? Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but like a lotus blooming from a murky pond, it sparks joy for the wary stock pickers.\\n\\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Microsoft is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.8 percentage points to 42%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\\n\\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\\n\\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Microsoft's future profits.\\n\\nAre Microsoft Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\\n\\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$2.5t company like Microsoft. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth US$1.5b. This suggests to me that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nShould You Add Microsoft To Your Watchlist?\\n\\nMicrosoft's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders certainly brightens my view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So to my mind Microsoft is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 1 warning sign  with Microsoft , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.\\n\\nAlthough Microsoft certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, too, then this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.\\n\\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

       " \"Launched on 05/15/2000, the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\\n\\nThe fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $31.58 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\\n\\nWhy Large Cap Blend\\n\\nCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.\\n\\nBlend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.\\n\\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.\\n\\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.10%.\\n\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\n\\nETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\n\\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 28.80% of the portfolio.

The Russell 1000 Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market. The Index is a float-adjusted capitalization-weighted index of equity securities issued by the approximately 1,000 largest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe ETF has gained about 26.87% so far this year and is up about 32.68% in the last one year (as of 11/16/2021). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $200.01 and $263.91.\\n\\nThe ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 22.82% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1030 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\\n\\nAlternatives\\n\\nIShares Russell 1000 ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, IWB is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market.

Microsoft is currently expanding its tally of 250 centers by 50 a year.\\n\\n“Our plan is to have Sweden as one of the largest in Europe, equivalent to the Dublin and Amsterdam footprints,” Microsoft’s Noelle Walsh, who runs the infrastructure side of the company, said in an interview. “Almost every country in the world wants a set of data centers now.”\\n\\nThe rapid growth in the energy hungry service means an increasing exposure to the huge swings in prices, according to Walsh. While the energy crisis is costing Microsoft “hundreds of millions of dollars within the year,” the shift to renewables is helping to offset soaring gas prices, she said. It’s also key to meeting the company’s target of becoming carbon negative by 2030.\\n\\n“We really focus on the way we can build data centers in a way that meets our carbon negative goal,” said Microsoft’s Chief Environmental Officer Lucas Joppa.\\n\\nAs part of that drive, the centers are Microsoft’s first to have back-up generators that run on diesel containing at least 50% renewable raw material.\\n\\nClient Base\\n\\nThe Swedish centers have drawn in clients including Svenska Handelsbanken AB and PostNord AB. “Businesses of all sizes and industries can now host their cloud workloads,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.\\n\\nOne industry attracted to such technology is firms mining cryptocurrencies, which need vast amounts of energy to solve encryption tasks and receive assets in reward. That “proof of work” method has sparked outrage from Sweden’s financial watchdog, which is now calling for a European Union-wide ban on such methods.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“The two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, are estimated to use about twice as much electricity in one year as is used throughout Sweden,” Erik Thedeen, the head of Sweden’s FSA, wrote in an opinion piece in Dagens Nyheter earlier this month.\\n\\nMicrosoft wouldn’t comment if specific clients came from this industry but said paid customers must adhere to an Acceptable Use Policy.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney renewed his attack on the duopoly power of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the world’s dominant mobile platforms at a conference in Seoul Tuesday.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAmazon Sued Over Crashes by Drivers Rushing to Make Deliveries Biden Plan Funds New Bridges That Locals May Not Want What Designers of Video Game Cities Understand About Real Cities Hong Kong's New Museum Tries to Please Art World — and Beijing\\n\\n“Apple locks a billion users into one store and payment processor,” Sweeney said at the Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness in South Korea, home to the world’s first law requiring mobile platforms to give users a choice of payment handlers. “Now Apple complies with oppressive foreign laws, which surveil users and deprive them of political rights. But Apple is ignoring laws passed by Korea’s democracy. Apple must be stopped.”\\n\\nRead More About Apple’s Fight With Epic Games\\n\\nGoogle also earned a strong rebuke from Sweeney, who criticized its approach of charging fees on payments it doesn’t process as “crazy.” Praising Korea for leading the fight against anti-competitive practices with its recent legislation, the Epic Games founder said “I’m very proud to stand up against these monopolies with you. I’m proud to stand with you and say I’m a Korean.”\\n\\nApple and Google representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nEpic has been locked in a legal fight with Apple and Google for over a year after it forced the issue of how payments within their app stores are handled by releasing a version of its global hit game Fortnite that included its own system to purchase in-game items. Fortnite was removed from both the App Store and Play Store for breaching their rules, prompting Sweeney’s company to sue the two operators. Legal filings from Epic this week alleged Google set up an internal task force to confront the issue of Fortnite sidestepping the company’s app store and fees.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGoogle Formed ‘Fortnite Task Force’ in Response to Epic’s Moves\\n\\nApple and Google have consistently said that the fees they charge on purchases via their mobile marketplaces help provide security for users and a global audience for developers. Sweeney sees their exclusionary practices as anathema to the founding principles of the web, arguing that their “policies are so restrictive that if the worldwide web had been embedded after the smartphone, then Apple and Google would have blocked all web browsers from being released on their platforms.”\\n\\nEpic Games operates its own Epic Games Store for PC gamers, which also charges a platform fee, albeit a lower one, and Sweeney doesn’t dispute Google and Apple’s right to profit from their work.\\n\\n“There’s a store market, there’s a payments market, and there are many other related markets,” he said. “And it’s critical that antitrust enforcement not allow a monopolist in one market to use their control of that market to impose control over unrelated markets.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nFirst Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images One of the World’s Poorest Countries Found a Better Way to Do Stimulus Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged Lordstown’s Auto Industry Is Coming Back.

       " \"(Bloomberg) -- New Amazon cloud chief Adam Selipsky plans to tailor more products to specific sectors such as the healthcare, automotive and telecommunications industries, a shift for a business that once focused on broader solutions that can be used by most customers.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nStartup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation What Designers of Video Game Cities Understand About Real Cities Elizabeth Holmes Faces Last-Ditch Chance to Testify at Trial Chronically Underfunded HBCUs Eye Scholarships in Biden Bill\\n\\n“The world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different,” Selipsky told Bloomberg Television. “It doesn't matter what we did yesterday.”\\n\\nTo a certain extent, Amazon Web Services is taking a page from rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which have been rolling out cloud packages designed for certain sectors. Microsoft, for example, offers targeted clouds to the healthcare, retail and space industries. Selipsky’s predecessor Andy Jassy, now CEO of parent company Amazon.com Inc., typically avoided doing special or one-off products, even when customers asked for it. Jassy resisted tailoring cloud services to the unique requirements of governments, although he eventually relented.\\n\\nAWS is by far the leader in the business of providing rented computing infrastructure, and serves companies in virtually every industry. But Selipsky said customers are demanding various new products and focuses, including sector-specific offerings, “which we’re starting to do now for industries like financial services and telco and healthcare and automotive. And we’re doing really exciting things for all of those industries and more.”\\n\\nThe strategy isn’t without challenges. A shift to tailored products risks spreading efforts too thin or slicing the company’s strategy too finely. Already some executives and workers say they’re leaving for startups and new areas because they say it’s becoming harder to do broad, enterprising work at AWS. Still, cloud software applications sold as a service are highly profitable for companies like Microsoft, more so than the infrastructure services where Amazon still dominates.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nJassy’s Right Hand\\n\\nSelipsky was tapped as AWS chief in March after Jassy was picked to replace founder Jeff Bezos as CEO of all of Amazon. Selipsky spent five years at the helm of Tableau, guiding the Seattle company through a reboot of its data visualization software business and $15.3 billion sale to Salesforce.com in 2019. Before joining Tableau, Selipsky was Jassy’s right hand at AWS, serving in a chief operating officer-like role that saw him overseeing the unit’s sales, marketing, technical support and customer service. He joined the company in 2005.\\n\\nAsked whether Amazon needs to focus more on office productivity apps, like Microsoft’s cloud-based Office or Google’s Workspace, Selipsky said AWS still has the “broadest and the deepest set of cloud services” but that it’s important for the cloud giant to build more applications. “It might be marketing, it might be human resources,” he said, citing Amazon Connect, a call-center program that demonstrates the company’s ability to build specific applications on top of general-purpose cloud services. In other cases, Amazon will leave the more granular products to partners to build, he said. Either way, he acknowledged that AWS must avoid getting too comfortable.\\n\\n“It's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents,” Selipsky said.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images One of the World’s Poorest Countries Found a Better Way to Do Stimulus Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",

       " 'Just as it looked as though Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) would rally again, its quarterly earnings rained on its parade. PLTR stock lost 12% on the week, breaking down below the critical 20-, 50-, and 200-day moving average at around $25. A banner for Palantir (PLTR) hangs on the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhat did investors not like about Palantir’s third-quarter results?\\n\\nPLTR Stock Slumps After Q3/2021 Report\\n\\nIn the quarter, Palantir added 34 new customers and closed 54 deals worth $1 million or more. 18 of those deals were valued at $10 million or more. In total, Palantir grew revenue by 36% year-over-year to $392 million. At an annualized $1.57 billion and a $45.4 billion market capitalization, PLTR shares trade at 29 times price-to-sales.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nValue investors could buy Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 14 times sales or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at 6.8 times. Still, that valuation comparison is not fair. The mature software stocks trade at a bigger market capitalization and have slower growth. Palantir expects revenue will grow by 40% to $1.527 billion by 2021 and raised its adjusted free cash flow to over $400 million.\\n\\nThree Themes to Growth\\n\\nStrong deal value, growing 50% to $3.6 billion, signals strong business ahead. Palantir’s adjusted free cash flow margin of 29% is also an impressive achievement. Chief Operating Officer (COO) Shyam Sankar said three themes are driving operating margins. First, it is seeing more traction with the defense industrial customer. Second, mobility is growing in the automotive sector. Third, its growth in healthcare is rising.\\n\\n7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the Holiday Tech Rush\\n\\nInvestors may refer to NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) as an example of a semiconductor firm benefiting from the technology innovation in automobiles.\\n\\nPalantir has customers in the mobility space that includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM), their suppliers, EV charging companies, and insurers. For example, Palantir is helping the National Health Service (NHS) analyze information for millions of patients. COO Sankar said, “We have a very unique opportunity and a diverse footprint that we believe continues to uniquely position us deliver on the necessary transformation in healthcare delivery from operational excellence to complex clinical care.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nChief Executive Officer Alex Karp expects the company will have annual revenue growth of 30% or more from 2021 through 2025.\\n\\nOpportunity\\n\\nPalantir’s customers in healthcare and government may potentially expand their technology spending budgets. Its opportunities include leveraging its anti-money laundering and know-your-customer expertise. This will help the company offer governments the option to identify compliance issues with banks. In turn, banks will respond by strengthening their compliance programs.\\n\\nPalantir can implement solutions quickly. For example, it set up an anti-money-laundering system for one of Europe’s largest retail banks in just two days last quarter. Banks may justify the return on investment (ROI) based only on the speed of the installation. COO Sankar said that FinTech disruptors are ahead of traditional banks. In the Q3 2021 earnings conference call on Nov.9, he said, “legacy compliance solutions are often 2 or more decades behind. We believe there are no alternatives that can compete on cost, speed, and performance.”\\n\\nPalantir has a strong moat that gives customers an edge. Expect the company to win more customers in the coming year. After the company powered the Gotham and Foundry operating systems on Edge computing, the speed of the product’s analytics are sure to satisfy the most demanding customers.\\n\\nStock Dilution Risks\\n\\nInvestors are not benefiting immediately from Palantir’s growth as earnings are diluted. Insider sales are hurting shareholders. Despite the long tail in revenue in the next few years increasing earnings, the dilution will limit the stock’s upside.\\n\\nPLTR stock already tripled since its initial public offering. As long as management grows the company faster than it dilutes shareholders, the stock will outperform the index. For now, investors should assume the stock is stuck in a $22 – $27 trading range because earnings per share are not expanding.\\n\\nFair Value\\n\\nOn the Stockrover stock grading site, Palantir stock has a fair quality and valuation score.\\n\\nPalantir scores a 41/100 on quality. This is on the low side because of the weak return on invested capital. Gross margins are stronger than the S&P 500 average. As costs fall and revenues rise, its quality score will improve.\\n\\nThe value score is 42/100. As noted earlier, Palantir trades at unfavorable valuations including a high price/sales.\\n\\nThe average price target, based on analysts, is $22.60. This suggests the stock has no near-term upside.\\n\\nYour Takeaway on PLTR Stock\\n\\nPalantir is a technology investment that requires a holding period of at least three years. Thankfully for them, government contracts last many years. Upon renewal, the amount may increase. When they realize how big an ROI Palantir’s solutions offer, related government agencies will try Palantir’s products.\\n\\nNow that shares are down slightly, Palantir is a stock to consider again.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The world was being revolutionized by the Internet, dot-coms and technology companies.\\n\\nBy the late 1990s, the “tech titans” of Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Dell were must-owns.\\n\\nMicrosoft MSFT and Cisco CSCO weren’t dot-coms that made no money. These companies were blue chips that made billions.\\n\\nInvestors poured money into their shares.\\n\\nFrom Jan 2, 1998 to Jan 3, 2000, Microsoft shares jumped 240%.\\n\\nDuring that same time, Cisco, which was one of the hottest stocks of the decade gaining over 10,000%, was up another 447%.\\n\\nBut these weren’t even the hottest tech companies.\\n\\nQUALCOMM QCOM was a day-trader favorite.

Subscribe\\n\\nWednesday, November 17, 2021\\n\\nThe PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be even scarcer than experts previously estimated\\n\\nWith the shopping season nearly upon us, some of the year’s most sought after gifts will once again be Sony’s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox Series X, and (NTDOY) Nintendo’s Switch.\\n\\nAnd if you thought those consoles were hard to get before, as our own Ihsaan Fanusie pointed out, buckle up, because, according to at least one industry analyst, the system makers are expected to sell some 3.34 million fewer units this calendar year than previous estimates indicated — dropping the total expected sales from 44.3 million to 40.9 million.\\n\\n“There's been a reduction in 2021 of shipments in my model from July to November that's down about 3.34 million units,” IDC research director of gaming Lewis Ward told Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nThat expected reduction in sales, a result of the ongoing chip shortage, means that a year after the consoles launched, gamers will still have a hard time getting their calloused thumbs on them. And the end of the supply shortage is far from over.\\n\\nSony and Nintendo have cut forecasts\\n\\nWith the ongoing supply chain crisis and global chip shortage, experts have generally advised that the best way to get what you need this holiday season is to buy as early as possible. And while that might work for things like sneakers, pots and pans, and bicycles, game consoles have been in short supply year round.\\n\\nStory continues Sony has reportedly cut its year-end PlayStation 5 sales estimate. (Photo by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nEver since they launched in November 2000, the Series X and PS5 have been incredibly difficult to find. According to Mat Piscatella, video game advisor at NPD Group, both consoles are selling at historic or near historic rates.\\n\\n“When compared to historical benchmarks, supply has been good. PlayStation 5 has been the fastest selling PlayStation to date, and the Xbox Series is very close to being the fastest selling Xbox,” he said. “However, while at this point in previous cycles hardware was more widely available, what we're seeing this generation is elevated demand that supply has thus far been unable to meet.”\\n\\nI’ve seen this scarcity firsthand. Since last year, I've been trying to help my friends get a pair of PS5s. I’ve set up Twitter alerts, followed news posts saying that stores have them in stock, and scoured retail websites — and still haven’t been able to grab one.\\n\\nEach time I get to a website, the systems are sold out. And that was before Sony and Nintendo revealed that they were cutting the number of consoles they expect to ship this year.\\n\\nAccording to Bloomberg, Sony was originally expecting to ship more than 16 million units by March 2022. But the company cut that number by 1 million, meaning it now expects to ship 15 million units by March. That will only compound the availability problem for shoppers.\\n\\n“Our partners are performing really well for us, but the chip shortage is definitely a challenge that we are all navigating,” Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan said back in July.\\n\\nNintendo, meanwhile, cut its full year sales expectations for its Nintendo Switch Line by 1.5 million units, from 25.5 million to 24 million. Microsoft, for its part, doesn’t release sales figures for its Xbox hardware. The company’s consoles have been just as hard to come by as Sony’s.

(Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\nIt’s all about the chips ... and the supply chain\\n\\nSo what’s keeping the consoles from store shelves? You guessed it, the global chip shortage. Oh, and you can toss in a dash of the supply chain crisis, too. See, game consoles have been among the most sought after means of entertainment since the start of the pandemic. So when the new consoles hit smack in the middle of the pandemic, demand shot through the roof.\\n\\nBut the chip shortage, which kicked off as consumers sought out everything from computers and webcams to cars, has kept the supply of those new consoles incredibly tight. It didn’t help that bots designed to snatch up consoles from online stores, were beating out real people who wanted the systems.\\n\\nAll of that adds up to a year in which it was seemingly impossible for people to buy the consoles they wanted.\\n\\nThen there’s the supply chain crunch. Slamming the brakes on the gears that power global manufacturing is hard enough. But getting it up and running again is even more difficult. Getting goods to manufacturers that can be turned into things like consoles is taking far longer than it otherwise would.\\n\\nIt doesn’t help that U.S. ports have been functioning about as well as a kinked hose, with too many goods coming in and only a few trickling out to stores. As a result, game consoles that are built and ready to go are unable to get to stores fast enough to meet consumer demand. Nintendo recently announced that it is cutting its full year estimate for Switch sales.. (Photo by Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe shortage in available consoles has sent aftermarket sellers’ prices through the roof. We’re talking about a PS5 with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $499 selling for as much as $1,200 on eBay. Or an Xbox Series X, also priced at $499, selling for $1,000. And that’s not counting limited edition versions of the console, which can sell for $1,500.\\n\\nAnd in case you’re wondering, those prices are outrageous. Sure, the consoles are fun, but the majority of new games are still available for last-generation's PlayStation 4 and Xbox One X. Shelling out an extra $500 isn’t worth it when you’ll eventually be able to get the new consoles.\\n\\nSo when can I get those consoles?\\n\\nThe biggest question for anyone hoping to get a console for themselves or someone they love is, “When will they be available?” And unfortunately, there’s no truly clear answer. The PS5 and Xbox Series X both use AMD (AMD) chips, and AMD CEO Lisa Su has said that the chip shortage should be less severe by the second half of 2022.\\n\\nThat’s just the chips, though. That means you’ll still have to wait for them to be dropped into consoles and have those shipped around the world.\\n\\nSo if you were hoping to grab a console this holiday season, chances are you’ll be out of luck.\\n\\nPiscatella advises hopeful consumers to follow retailers’ social media feeds for news of when they’ll have new consoles in stock and then try their hand at snagging one. But, he adds, don’t expect to just walk into your local Best Buy or other retailer to get one from the store shelf.\\n\\nIn a few months, however, supplies should start to catch up with demand, and you’ll be able to grab one without having to fight everyone else on the internet, or overpaying by an exorbitant amount.\\n\\nFor now, hold on to your old consoles and enjoy them for one more year.\\n\\nBy Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn\",\n",

       " 'NVIDIA’s NVDA proposed deal to acquire U.K.-based semiconductor chip designer, Arm Holdings, encountered another major hurdle after the British government ordered an in-depth investigation of the transaction over competition and national security concerns.\\n\\nU.K.’s Secretary of State for Culture and Digital, Nadine Dorries, yesterday revealed that she has instructed the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) to carry a “Phase Two” probe of the proposed acquisition.\\n\\nThe CMA has been given 24 weeks to deliver a final report, with a provision to extend the time frame for eight more weeks. Based on the reports filed by the agency, the U.K. government could block the deal on one or both grounds, clear it on both grounds or approve it with certain conditions.\\n\\nWhat’s Concerning Agencies About the NVIDIA-Arm Deal?\\n\\nThe reliable access to Arm’s technologies and the resilient supply chain are of utmost importance for the U.K.’s national security and defense departments. Moreover, the England-based chip designer is often referred to as the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry and plays a neutral role in the space. Therefore, the deal is feared to block this chip access neutrality and could favor the U.S. owner over its rivals.\\n\\nThe CMA in its August 2021 report has already warned that following the acquisition, NVIDIA could cut off Arm’s technology access to its rivals and lead to lesser competition, stifle innovation and push up chip prices.\\n\\nNVIDIA-Arm Deal Faces Multiple Hurdles\\n\\nOn Sep 13, 2020, NVIDIA inked an agreement to acquire Arm from its existing owner, Softbank Group Corporation, in a cash-and-stock deal worth $40 billion. A rise of approximately 147% in NVDA’s stock price has increased the value of the deal more than $50 billion.\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\\n\\nHowever, the deal has caught the attention of competition regulatory bodies of several countries. Following the initiation of the investigation from the CMA in January 2021, the U.S. competition regulator, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) opened a probe on grounds of competition in February.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe FTC has sought more detailed information about the transaction from all the three companies — NVIDIA, Arm and Softbank. It has also asked other relevant companies that might provide information regarding this deal.\\n\\nThe European and Chinese regulatory bodies are also gearing up to launch lengthy investigations over whether the sale of Arm to NVIDIA could impact competition and disrupt the global industry-wide chip supply chain.\\n\\nTech Giants Opposing the Deal\\n\\nAdditionally, several tech companies, including Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, Microsoft MSFT and Qualcomm QCOM, have opposed the transaction and asked the U.S. anti-trust regulators to intervene.\\n\\nThese firms are arguing that the acquisition would provide NVIDIA control over Arm’s intellectual property (“IP”) rights, which license chip designs and related software to those willing to pay for the same, including rivals to one another.\\n\\nQualcomm has been more vocal in opposing the deal. Arm supplies IP rights to the company whose chip designs are found in most of the smartphones around the globe. The company is worried that following the acquisition, NVIDIA could limit its access to Arm’s chip licenses, which have built its mobile chip empire using the latter’s designs.\\n\\nQualcomm has also stated that it is open to invest in Arm if the regulatory bodies block NVIDIA’s deal. Arm’s other customers, Alphabet and Microsoft, have also voiced similar concerns that NVDA might limit the access to Arm’s technologies or raise the prices.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nNVIDIA aims to integrate its AI computing platform with Arm’s expertise in a bid to create a premier computing entity. Additionally, the company had earlier stated that the transaction would be immediately accretive to the non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP earnings per share post the transaction’s closure.\\n\\nHowever, looking at the protest by major tech companies and the intensifying antitrust scrutiny by several regulators across the world, it would be a difficult task for NVIDIA to win an approval for Arm’s acquisition.\\n\\nWith multiple antitrust agencies initiating fresh in-depth probes, NVDA is most likely to miss its initial target of completing the acquisition in March 2022. The European Union has set a Mar 15, 2022 deadline to disclose its final decision about the proposed transaction. Also, U.K.’s “Phase Two” probe’s time frame of 24 weeks plus an eight-week extension translates that the government’s final decision would come by June-end 2022.\\n\\nCurrently, Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while NVIDIA and Qualcomm carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\n\\nThe long-term earnings growth rate projections for Alphabet, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Microsoft are pegged at 25.8%, 19.5%, 17.5% and 12%, respectively. Shares of GOOGL, NVDA, QCOM and MSFT have soared 68.7%, 131.3%, 19.3% and 52.6%, respectively, in the year so far.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       " 'Retail giants are offering to pay for employees\\' college education in a bid to attract more talent amid a historic race to fill open positions.\\n\\nTech giant Microsoft (MSFT) is one of those companies — but it\\'s also charting a unique course.\\n\\nUnlike Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and other companies offering free tuition for employees who wish to upgrade their skills in almost any field at in a variety of colleges, Microsoft is honing in on community colleges to fill a specific but urgent need: More cybersecurity professionals.\\n\\nLooking at the demand for educational programs they launched after the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft found that \"the appetite is there,\" Naria Santa Lucia, general manager of digital inclusion and U.S. community engagement at Microsoft Philanthropies, told Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nThe company also realized that \"people weren\\'t completing the course pathways as much as we would have liked,\" Lucia added, \"and what we realized is we need to get really targeted and look very carefully at the roles that we know are going to expand.\" Microsoft Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Satya Nadella, gestures as he addresses the Future Decoded Tech Summit in Bangalore on February 25, 2020. (Photo by Manjunath Kiran / AFP)\\n\\n\\'There is more the private sector can do\\'\\n\\nMicrosoft identified cybersecurity as a field with a massive shortage of workers, and is hoping to fill 250,000 cybersecurity jobs in the U.S. by the middle of the decade. (With an increase in the number of data breaches and hacks, the need is urgent.)\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe company is hoping to help train and recruit about 250,000 people into cybersecurity by 2025. Some may end up working with Microsoft, its clients, or other employers across the country.\\n\\n\"Then we thought about, \\'Hey, what\\'s the best way we can really reach scale in this?\\' And we really believe that the community college system in the United States is just a great resource,\" Lucia explained. \"There are community colleges everywhere. The tuition is generally affordable. If you are lower income, you can apply for aid and sometimes get that fully covered. It\\'s diverse. People go part-time [or] full-time. I think the average age is often about 26 years old in a given space. ... It just offers a broad range and opportunity.\"\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s approach is markedly different from what other retail giants have offered to workers in a bid to attract more talent. A student at The Los Angeles Community College campus on Monday August 30th of Los Angeles City College (LACC) in the LACCD, the nation\\'s largest community college district. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images).\\n\\nPartnering with community colleges, for instance, is different from Amazon\\'s and Walmart\\'s efforts, given that the company is investing in \"not necessarily on the current employees at Microsoft, but on society as a whole,\" Lucia added.\\n\\nFor instance, if a worker was currently employed in a retail job or a different industry and wanted to try out something new, Microsoft is hoping to create a runway for that person to pursue a role in cybersecurity at a low cost.\\n\\nMicrosoft, according to its press release, is providing funding and training for faculty at 150 community colleges, and scholarships and resources to 25,000 students.\\n\\nThe tech giant\\'s interest is likely a boon to some two-year colleges, given that enrollment has taken a beating at these institutions.\\n\\nAccording to early data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, undergraduate enrollment continued to decline in fall 2021 by 3.2% after dropping last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Enrollment at community colleges dropped by 5.6%, more than at public four-year colleges, which dropped by 2.3%.\\n\\nAlready, colleges have started benefitting from the program. El Paso Community College was recently reported to have received a $50,000 grant from Microsoft for the its cybersecurity program. Store employees wait for customers during the grand opening of a flagship Microsoft Corp. retail store in New York, October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\\n\\nAccording to Lucia, working with community colleges made sense because of the outcomes.\\n\\nWhen Microsoft partnered with nonprofits to deliver its content, completion rates \"went through the roof,\" she explained. \"And that was the way when we realized, yes, there is a breadth offering that\\'s important, but let\\'s really double down and partner with those that are already in the space so already trusted by the learners, like community colleges to really do something different and take a different approach.\"\\n\\nLucia also hinted at more commitments coming down the pike in the near future.\\n\\n\"If it is a PR push for companies, I say we should all push more,\" she said. \"There is more the private sector can do to partner with the public sector, with nonprofits, with the higher education system. This is a moment where we all have to have hands on deck with the changes in the labor market.\"\\n\\n—\\n\\nAarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com.

       " '(Bloomberg) -- Legacy software platforms like SAP, Oracle and Microsoft should be designated as unfair digital “gatekeepers” in new European Union rules to address anti-competitive behavior by big technology companies, four groups are urging.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nStartup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation Elizabeth Holmes Faces Last-Ditch Chance to Testify at Trial Chronically Underfunded HBCUs Eye Scholarships in Biden Bill\\n\\nIn a letter to EU lawmakers seen by Bloomberg News, the technology groups said the bloc’s Digital Markets Act -- being debated before it becomes law sometime next year -- “falls short” of addressing software providers’ “unfair” licensing practices. The companies are locking in customers and self-preferencing when offering cloud services, according to the letter addressed to MEPs and the Commission.\\n\\n“Those ‘software gatekeepers’ should not use their market power to reduce contestability in the cloud infrastructure services market,” Belgium’s Beltug, France’s Cigref, the Netherlands’ CIO Platform and Germany’s Voice e.V. wrote. “Software is as critical as search engines or social media in the digital economy.”\\n\\nThe Digital Markets Act currently focuses on anti-competitive behaviors by social media and online marketplace companies like Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook; Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc.. While that has prompted criticism that European lawmakers are targeting U.S.-based companies, some parliamentarians are trying to broaden the rules to include more companies like software providers.\\n\\nThe groups seeking the inclusion of software platforms represent more than 2,500 chief innovation officers and almost 700 businesses organizations in the four EU countries, including L’Oreal SA, Zalando SE and Volkswagen AG.\\n\\nTheir concerns about anti-competitive behavior are based on research from Frédéric Jenny, an economics professor at ESSEC Paris Business, who detailed how software providers could “leverage their strong, sometimes dominant, position in adjacent products in order to distort competition for cloud infrastructure services.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThese practices often don’t fall under the EU’s current competition laws and “could necessitate the recourse to new legal instruments,” Jenny wrote in October in a report commissioned by CISPE, a nonprofit trade group representing cloud service providers.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged India’s Race to Vaccinate Its Villages Meets With Rural Resistance\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       " 'Stocks finished Tuesday within a whisker of new record highs. Led by a resurgence in tech stocks, the S&P 500 gained 0.40% on the session. But when you look beneath the surface, you’ll find buyers drove a dozen popular stocks higher by more than 4%. A select few even topped a 10% gain on the session. So after the bell, I waded through the biggest movers and found many breakout stocks to buy.\\n\\nToday I’ll share my favorite three. Rather than going the lazy route and sticking with the top three gainers, I assessed the overall price trend to find the healthiest charts and patterns.\\n\\nTwo of today’s selections had specific catalysts behind Tuesday’s boom. Better-than-expected earnings played a role in one. Ambitious growth plans outlined by the CEO spurred the other.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\n7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the Holiday Tech Rush\\n\\nWhile the final company didn’t show as much spunk, its long-term trend and proximity to a critical breakout zone demanded a mention.\\n\\nThat said, here are three hot stocks to trade now:\\n\\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\\n\\nLet’s dig a bit deeper into the news and price action that support new buys.\\n\\nBreakout Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) stock chart with bullish breakout\\n\\nSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade\\n\\nQualcomm shares were already riding high after reporting solid earnings numbers earlier this month. But buyers slammed the pedal to the medal after company executives painted a rosy future during investor day.\\n\\nQCOM stock closed up 7.9%, with over 33 million shares changing hands.\\n\\nCEO Cristiano Amon outlined plans for the semiconductor giant to expand into the automotive industry and the Internet of Things. Doing so will diversify the company’s revenue streams outside of mobile devices, allowing for other growth engines.\\n\\nInvestors lapped up the promising targets while buying shares hand over fist. QCOM shares are sitting at a record high and should continue higher in the weeks to come.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn the short run, a pullback would be welcome. With the earnings gap, prices have traveled a long way in a short period. For those that don’t want to wait, consider buying call spreads.\\n\\nThe Trade: Buy the January $180/$190 bull call spread for $3.90.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) stock chart with bullish breakout.\\n\\nSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade\\n\\nMicrosoft climbed 1% to a fresh record amid strength in the tech sector.\\n\\nThough not as eye-popping as the fireworks seen in Qualcomm, MSFT stock is a worthy candidate for new bull plays. It has a history of rewarding breakout buyers.\\n\\nI’m particularly impressed by the brevity of last week’s pullback. Rather than a long sortie, sellers got a few shots off and then headed for the hills rapidly. And after such a lengthy upswing, you would have expected more profit-taking.\\n\\n7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the Holiday Tech Rush\\n\\nShallow and short-lived retracements always echo a trend’s strength. Tack on year-end seasonality and the market’s current affection for all things tech, and we have a compelling case for higher prices. Call spreads are once again my strategy of choice.\\n\\nThe Trade: Buy the January $340/$360 bull call for $7.40.\\n\\nBreakout Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) stock chart with high base breakout.\\n\\nSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade\\n\\nHome Depot brings up the rear of today’s breakout stocks to buy. Homebuilder stocks have been on fire this year, and even though Home Depot was up significantly for 2021, Tuesday morning earnings were still powerful enough to tack on another 5.7% in gains.\\n\\nWith the launch, HD stock completed a clean high-base breakout pattern. Volume swelled past 8 million shares marking the highest volume session since the last quarterly report. As a result, any backing and filling must be viewed as a buying opportunity over the coming days.\\n\\nI hate to be a broken record, but I’m favoring bull call spreads given the hefty share price. It reduces the cost considerably, and implied volatility isn’t high enough for bull puts.\\n\\nThe Trade: Buy the January $390/$410 bull call for $8.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Tyler Craig was long QCOM.

       " \"It’s looking increasingly like we’re headed for a shift in the market’s status quo. The aftershock of 2008 has put us in a zero interest rate policy (aka, ZIRP) that has lasted more than a decade now. And mega-cap stocks are a smart way to keep your portfolio healthy through the transition.\\n\\nWhen ZIRP launched, it was a leap into the unknown. No one knew if it was going to even work, much less how long it would last. It was a wrenching transition, but after it was done, the market stayed on a bull run for a very long time. And mega-cap stocks led the way.\\n\\nWe now have six stocks with a market cap above $1 trillion. There were none in 2010. But after this central bank-led era of ZIRP and expanding markets, inflation can’t be stemmed any longer.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\n7 Games and Toy Stocks to Buy as the Christmas Season Approaches\\n\\nThese six mega-cap stocks will be harbors from the storm at least and strong growth picks at best.\\n\\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Disney (NYSE:DIS) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\\n\\nMega-Cap Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil (XOM) logo outside of a corporate building\\n\\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOne of the original Big Oil companies, its mantle of largest publicly traded oil company in the world was usurped by Saudi Aramco in recent years. But Aramco is state-owned, so XOM remains the biggest predominantly publicly held firm.\\n\\nHowever, up until recently, massive integrated oil companies weren’t doing well. The pandemic certainly hammered them. But even before that, the global economy was chugging along with low growth and low interest rates. Alternative energy was becoming big, and electric vehicles were starting to show up in greater numbers.\\n\\nWell, those days are quickly passing behind us. And XOM is back. Its earnings are still negative, but that will change quickly.\\n\\nXOM stock is up 55% year-to-date and it even has an inflation-beating 5.5% dividend to add to its attraction.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThis stock has an ‘A’ rating in my Portfolio Grader.\\n\\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\\n\\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThis tech firm has seen plenty of market transitions over the years. Launched in the mid-1980s, CSCO was the king of the networking companies as the dotcom boom got underway.\\n\\nIt was one of the leading companies that brought in the concept of EBITDA and all-stock buyouts of other tech firms. Those were some wild times. Now, it’s an old timer in the tech world and has a nearly $240 billion market cap. And in a sure sign of its maturity, it also has a 2.6% dividend to keep its long-term investors happy.\\n\\nIt may not grab the headlines like it did in the ‘90s, but it’s still a force in the networking, mobility and security markets. Its durability and market leadership makes it a worthy member of the mega-cap stocks club.\\n\\n7 Auto Stocks That Could Race to New Highs Going Into 2022\\n\\nThis stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader.\\n\\nMega-Cap Stocks: Disney (DIS) Walt Disney (DIS) logo on mobile phone with Cinderella's castile in background\\n\\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLast week was not a good week for DIS. It lost 9% on the week after its earnings call. Many analysts cut their price and earnings expectations after hearing that Disney+ streaming service isn’t looking to regain much traction until late next year.\\n\\nThe company will be adding twice as much content from its current products in the meantime. That may help keep the service moving until more original content becomes available.\\n\\nBut instead of running away from this iconic content provider, this is a great time to buy it on sale. And that doesn’t happen very often.\\n\\nDIS stock’s current challenges don’t change its status as one of the most formidable mega-cap stocks out there. This company has been around for nearly 100 years now, and it’s still a powerful player in the entertainment industry.

It continues to be the biggest winner in internet advertising revenue and its mantle isn’t likely to be usurped anytime soon. From its humble beginnings as a free search engine to its current status is an amazing journey.\\n\\nAnd it’s not just its advertising revenue at this point. It also runs the world’s most popular mobile OS. It has a family of phones and other products that are gaining traction. It’s a leading cloud company with plans to expand in this sector. And it has dozens of other products growing and preparing for launch.\\n\\nIf things get dicey, GOOG is going to be a very popular port in the storm.

Financial writers always talk about how the fund underperforms the market in good times and maybe Buffett has lost a step or two. That’s been going on for decades.\\n\\nBRK.B continues to perform and draw in new investors. Why? Because it’s all about the long term. There’s an analogy about climate and weather that works for explaining BRK.B.\\n\\nIf you’re walking a dog on the beach, the dog will run up and down and side to side as the owner walks from point A to point B. The is like weather and the owner is like climate. Long term versus short term. The dog and owner end up in the same place.\\n\\nAnd so it is with BRK.B. The stock may not have the big runs, but it also avoids the big falls. It keeps outperforming year in and year out.

And it’s up 55% YTD.\\n\\nThis is the underlying power of these mega-cap stocks. It’s not only individual investors but institutional investors that see the value of these massive companies with global reach when the market starts to shift. And institutional investors have significantly more buying power than individual investors.\\n\\nThe reason I’m featuring these mega-cap stocks is the sheer fact that institutional investors see the changes coming and they’re moving into these shares as we speak. This is how the smart money makes maximizes changes in the economic cycle.\\n\\nBuy big and buy the best. Then, regardless of what happens, you have the best safety stocks available and the stocks most likely to succeed once the market regains its stride.\\n\\n7 Auto Stocks That Could Race to New Highs Going Into 2022\\n\\nThis stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier has positions in CSCO, DIS, GOOG, JPM and MSFT in this article.

       " 'Investors in Microsoft Corporation MSFT need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 21, 2022 $70.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\\n\\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\\n\\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\\n\\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\\n\\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Microsoft shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Microsoft is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in Computer - Software industry that ranks in Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, eight analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.19 per share to $2.28 in that period.\\n\\nGiven the way analysts feel about Microsoft right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\\n\\nLooking to Trade Options?\\n\\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Between Nvidia, Roblox and the re-christened Meta Platforms Inc., that equates to a combined $230 billion. Nvidia has gained 18% in November and Roblox is up 38%.\\n\\nMetaverse -- digital worlds where users can socialize, play games and conduct business -- is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, according to Epic Games Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney. Still, mass market adoption of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies will only occur when Apple Inc. joins the party, Morgan Stanley analysts have said.\\n\\n“The Metaverse is real -- but is emerging,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. “Some of most likely beneficiaries of metaverse gaming should be the platform companies and those with scale,” Campling said, citing the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Microsoft Corp.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley sees Meta Platforms and Roblox as among the obvious winners in a space that will likely take years to become mainstream, but for which the buzz is already loud and clear: Mentions of metaverse during third-quarter earnings calls surged for companies on the Bloomberg World Large & Mid Cap Price Return Index, with the word popping up three times more than in the previous quarter.\\n\\nIt’s not just a tech phenomenon. There’s a lot of chatter about styling digital avatars in social gaming with famous luxury brands. Indeed, a digital version of Gucci’s Dionysus bag sold on Roblox’s platform for about $4,115, well above the price of the physical item.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThough the metaverse’s full market potential is years away, it’s already been a boon for some companies in the future ecosystem. Arista Networks Inc. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc are among stocks that have soared this month amid optimism that the likes of Meta Platforms and Amazon will continue to spend on data center gear. Arista Networks has gained 29% in November and Seagate is up 16%.\\n\\n“Whatever the future looks like, it’s going to require accelerated computing,” said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager with Roosevelt Investment Group. “We keep thinking of new and better ways to utilize data and we wind up with tremendous growth in data transmission, which drives that cohort of companies whether or not the metaverse comes to reality.”\\n\\nREAD MORE: Nvidia’s Data Center Sales Expected to Be Standout: Preview\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nElon Musk sold more Tesla Inc. shares, bringing him almost halfway to his promise to unload 10% of his stake Amazon.com said it will stop accepting payments using Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year Baidu Inc.’s third-quarter sales climbed 13% as growth in newer businesses such as the cloud helped offset a slowdown in its main internet advertising division Alibaba Group emerged as the frontrunner to take over Tsinghua Unigroup for $7.8 billion to help keep China’s indebted chip champion afloat Qualcomm Inc. gave an upbeat sales forecast, fueled by growth in new markets.

       " \"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Blend category of the market, the FlexShares Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt ETF (TILT) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 09/16/2011.\\n\\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\\n\\nThe ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.\\n\\nBecause market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.\\n\\nHowever, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.\\n\\nBased on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.\\n\\nThe smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.\\n\\nFund Sponsor & Index\\n\\nThe fund is managed by Flexshares. TILT has been able to amass assets over $1.78 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Blend. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index before fees and expenses.\\n\\nThe Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index measures the performance of U.S. equity markets with increased exposure toward small-capitalization and value stocks.\\n\\nCost & Other Expenses\\n\\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.\\n\\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.10%.\\n\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\n\\nIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\n\\nFor TILT, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 23.30% of the portfolio --while Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.\\n\\nTaking into account individual holdings, Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT) accounts for about 3.89% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc Common Stock Usd 0.00001 (AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc Common Stock Usd 0.01 (AMZN).\\n\\nTILT's top 10 holdings account for about 18.48% of its total assets under management.\\n\\nPerformance and Risk\\n\\nThe ETF has added roughly 29.90% and it's up approximately 35.70% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 11/17/2021), respectively. TILT has traded between $135.77 and $184.34 during this last 52-week period.\\n\\nThe fund has a beta of 1.12 and standard deviation of 23.90% for the trailing three-year period, which makes TILT a medium risk choice in this particular space.

Its government business grew revenues and profits strongly, and ViaSat Inflight signed up over 2000 airplanes.

       " '(Bloomberg) -- While many other technology giants embrace the metaverse as the next frontier of growth, Sundar Pichai sees Google’s future in its oldest offering: internet search.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAmazon Sued Over Crashes by Drivers Rushing to Make Deliveries Startup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation What Designers of Video Game Cities Understand About Real Cities Biden Plan Funds New Bridges That Locals May Not Want Chronically Underfunded HBCUs Eye Scholarships in Biden Bill\\n\\n“I feel fortunate our mission is timeless,” Pichai, who is chief executive officer of Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang for the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore. “There’s more need to organize information than ever before.”\\n\\nEarlier this month, Alphabet briefly crossed $2 trillion in market value thanks to sales and profit growth during the pandemic. When asked where the next trillion would come from, Pichai pointed to his company’s core service. Consumers will ask computers more questions with voice and “multimodal experiences,” he predicted. “Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity,” the CEO said.\\n\\nSince taking over Google in 2015, Pichai has pushed the company deeper into cloud computing and artificial intelligence, while facing an increase in regulatory scrutiny. In the interview, Pichai ticked off Google’s key growth businesses -- cloud, the YouTube video service and its app store -- and said AI investments were “underlying” each of them.\\n\\nThe India-born executive also said he expects that more of Google’s products will be developed and tested in Asia first, before spreading across the globe. Not in China, though. After icing plans to bring search to mainland China in 2018, following an employee uproar, Google has kept most of its services out of the most populous nation. “I don’t see that changing,” Pichai said.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut he doesn’t share other Silicon Valley executives’ dim view of China’s tech advances. Pichai acknowledged that Google is “neck to neck” with Chinese companies in AI and quantum computing, but argued that the U.S. and China have room to collaborate in areas like climate change and AI safety.\\n\\nSome of Google’s largest peers, such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., have pitched their futures around the virtual worlds of the metaverse. Google has taken several approaches at virtual and augmented reality products, with limited success. Years ago, its first attempt, the Google Glass headgear, famously flopped. Google recently placed these efforts in a new division reporting to Pichai, although he didn’t provide specifics about the strategy.\\n\\n“I’ve always been excited about the future of immersive computing,” he said. “This doesn’t belong to any company. This is the evolution of the internet.”\\n\\nEvangelists of the metaverse often talk about the potential to build in new technologies like the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Aside from some cloud partnerships, Google has largely steered clear of this part of the industry.\\n\\nPichai said he doesn’t own any cryptocurrency. “I wish I did,” he said. “I’ve dabbled in it, you know, in and out.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images One of the World’s Poorest Countries Found a Better Way to Do Stimulus Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",
       " '(Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney may be the most enthusiastic supporter of the metaverse after Mark Zuckerberg, who renamed his entire company Meta Platforms Inc.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAmazon Sued Over Crashes by Drivers Rushing to Make Deliveries Startup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation What Designers of Video Game Cities Understand About Real Cities Biden Plan Funds New Bridges That Locals May Not Want Chronically Underfunded HBCUs Eye Scholarships in Biden Bill\\n\\nThe Epic founder has reason to be bullish, as his company’s Fortnite has rapidly evolved from a popular multiplayer game into an online space where people socialize and big-name musicians host virtual concerts. It competes with world-building games like Microsoft Corp.’s Minecraft and Roblox Corp.’s eponymous title in pursuing the metaverse vision of a virtual environment that would be the platform we use to interact with the internet and others, supplanting web browsers and mobile apps.\\n\\n“Over the coming decades, the metaverse has the potential to become a multitrillion-dollar part of the world economy,” the CEO said at a conference in Seoul on Tuesday. “The next three years are going to be critical for all of the metaverse-aspiring companies like Epic, Roblox, Microsoft, Facebook,” he said in an interview after. “It’s kind of a race to get to a billion users, whoever brings on a billion users first, would be the presumed leader in setting the standards.”\\n\\nFor Sweeney, the legal and rhetorical battle with mobile giants Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google over their locked-down app stores and payments is at least in part motivated by his aspirations for the metaverse and ensuring there’s a fair playing field for the companies competing to create it.\\n\\nEpic CEO Blasts Apple and Google, Calls for Single App Store\\n\\n“The metaverse is a term like the internet. No company can own it,” the Epic chief said.\\n\\nEpic’s metaverse strategy has two prongs: first is expanding Fortnite from a game with 60 million monthly active users to an experience that could reach a billion in the future, the CEO said. Complementary to that, the company wants to capitalize on its content-creation tools like the Unreal Engine for 3D graphics, “enabling all of the companies throughout the industry to have a real-time 3D presence.” On that front, Epic will face stiff competition from Nvidia Corp., whose CEO is similarly optimistic.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNvidia Joins Zuckerberg in Betting Metaverse Is Next Big Thing\\n\\nEven if Epic doesn’t build the definitive metaverse, Sweeney wants its software tools to provide the building blocks, offering carmakers as an example: they can use Unreal to visualize their products in design and manufacturing processes and later to produce digital advertisements. Fortnite added a Ferrari that players can drive in the game this July.\\n\\nThe company is working to “build one set of digital assets that can be deployed to film and television and in real-time games, scaling from high-end consoles down to low-end smartphones,” Sweeney said. And while he doesn’t believe that specialized hardware such as augmented or virtual reality glasses would be necessary to access the metaverse, Epic is collaborating with all designers and manufacturers of such devices, he said.\\n\\nEpic intends to take a similar approach to the other big growth opportunity for game developers: China. The company gave up on its multiyear effort to get Fortnite approved in the country this month, but will continue to offer its tools and software for other creators to make use of, he added.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images One of the World’s Poorest Countries Found a Better Way to Do Stimulus Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",
       " \"(Bloomberg) -- Investors’ concerns are mounting over the direction of Activision Blizzard Inc. under Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick, and a group of employees say it’s time for him to step down.The company, known for hit video games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, has been in turmoil since the summer, when it was sued by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of sexual harassment, unequal pay and retaliation. The agency described a “frat boy culture” at the company and accused leadership of failing to take action. Kotick’s plight worsened when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later launched its own investigation into how the company handled the reports of misconduct.The scandal has taken a toll on a company already struggling to adapt to the end of a pandemic-fueled video game boom. Earlier this month, Activision delayed two of its most anticipated games and gave a sales forecast for the fourth quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, sending the shares plunging the most in 13 years. Activision’s missteps allowed Roblox Corp., which began trading publicly earlier this year, to surpass it in market value, becoming the biggest U.S. video game company by that measure.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAmazon Sued Over Crashes by Drivers Rushing to Make Deliveries What Designers of Video Game Cities Understand About Real Cities Biden Plan Funds New Bridges That Locals May Not Want Startup Fever Is Gripping the World’s Last Big Untapped Nation Chronically Underfunded HBCUs Eye Scholarships in Biden Bill\\n\\nAnd that was before Tuesday, when the situation got even tougher for Kotick. Explosive revelations by the Wall Street Journal tie the CEO to allegations of mistreatment of women and suggest that he was aware for years of sexual misconduct, including rape, at the company but didn’t report it to the board. The newspaper cites interviews, company emails, regulatory requests and other internal documents in its reporting.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Journal said that several women accused Kotick of mistreatment, both inside and outside the workplace, and that in some cases he worked to settle the complaints quickly and quietly. The SEC has issued subpoenas to high-ranking executives, including Kotick, according to the paper. Activision’s shares fell an additional 6.1% on Tuesday, marking a 36% decline from a February high.Employees, who have for months said the company hasn’t gone far enough to address complaints, staged a walkout at Blizzard’s offices in Irvine, California, on Tuesday and called for Kotick’s resignation. About 150 people showed up, carrying signs that said: “Does Zero-Tolerance Apply to the C-Suite?” and “Unaccountable Corporate Bureaucrats are Driving the Best Employees out of Activision Blizzard.”Activision’s 10-member board, which includes two women, said it remains confident that Kotick “appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention,” and said it has faith in his leadership. However, he is unlikely to retain that support if any more bad news comes to light, said a person close to a board member, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.\\n\\nThe accusations against Kotick, especially that he withheld important details from the board, put his job in jeopardy, governance experts said.“In the current political environment, we’ve seen so many people step down or be forced to resign because of their potential knowledge of misconduct,” said Jill Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. While sexual misconduct in corporations “is a hot button issue right now,” the situation at Activision adds another layer of complexity in that “there is an independent concern here about hiding information from the board.”Kotick also sits on the boards of the Coca-Cola Co. and the Hawks Foundation. He is listed as a trustee for the Center for Early Education and the Harvard-Westlake School, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Coca-Cola representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Kotick's status as a board member.The 58-year-old Kotick launched his first company, a software developer, while still a student at the University of Michigan. In 1990, he and partner Brian Kelly bought control of a nearly bankrupt video game maker called Mediagenic and changed its name back to Activision. He has led Activision since 1992 and oversaw the incorporation of Blizzard Entertainment Inc. and a raft of other studios such as Candy Crush maker King Digital, allowing them to operate mostly independently as part of a strategy to encourage the development of hit games.\\n\\nAs a result, games like Diablo and Warcraft, are among the most acclaimed on the market. The Blizzard division was regularly ranked among the best places to work and served as a shining example of how to build a long-running game studio.So when the California lawsuit landed last summer, it sent shockwaves through the gaming world and broader public for the graphic images it portrayed about Blizzard— including “cube crawls,” in which male employees “drink copious amounts of alcohol as they crawl their way through various cubicles in the office and often engage in inappropriate behavior toward female employees.”\\n\\nBut to many within the company, it was no secret that partying and sexism were long part of Blizzard’s office culture. Dozens of employees spoke to Bloomberg and recounted episodes of women getting accosted for dates at the office, being subjected to alcohol-fueled hazing rituals and watching male colleagues use company events as an opportunity to solicit sex. Six women said they reported incidents to Blizzard’s HR department and saw no results.Video game companies were late to the global reckoning prompted by the #MeToo movement, which led to the ouster of prominent leaders across industries. In 2018, veteran CBS Corp. CEO Les Moonves was forced out after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct, and he was stripped of his $120 million severance package.\\n\\nChiefs at Barnes & Noble Inc. and Lululemon Athletica Inc. were ousted for sexual harassment allegations as well, and CEOs at Intel Corp. and the REI outdoor-equipment chain both resigned after news of consensual relationships with employees emerged, underscoring the changes in expectations for work environments. Microsoft Corp.’s Bill Gates also was tainted by scandal. The Wall Street Journal reported that the board found that the software billionaire’s involvement with a female employee almost two decades ago was inappropriate and decided last year that he would have to step down as a director. In the past year and a half, the video game industry began to have its own reckoning, prompted by an outpouring of allegations on social media in 2020. Ubisoft Entertainment SA, the French gaming giant behind blockbuster titles ranging from Assassin’s Creed to Far Cry, faced allegations of widespread sexual misconduct at the company last year that shook the family founders’ inner circle and raised major concerns about how the business was managed.\\n\\nWhile three high-ranking executives were ousted at Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot, the co-founder and CEO since 1988, remains in place, protected by four brothers on the board. Collectively the siblings hold 21% of the company’s stock. In February, Riot Games Inc. was sued by a former executive assistant of CEO Nicolo Laurent who alleges she was fired because she refused to have sex with him. If Kotick were to leave, the company has several potential successors waiting in the wings. They include Chief Operating Officer Daniel Alegre, who joined Activision as Kotick’s top lieutenant last year from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Chief Finance Officer Armin Zerza, who rose through the ranks at subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment before moving to the corporate office in 2019. Zerza, who came from Procter & Gamble Co., became close to Kotick and helped enact the CEO's vision at Blizzard.The July lawsuit from California’s employment watchdog and earlier protests by employees this summer spurred Activision into action. Kotick apologized, and the company has waged a public relations campaign to highlight measures taken to make it more inclusive and welcoming to its nearly 10,000 employees. In August, Blizzard President J. Allen Brack was ousted, in addition to a human resources executive. And in September, Activision agreed to pay $18 million in a settlement with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its workplace practices.Last month, the company said more than 20 staff “ exited” and at least 20 others have received disciplinary action as part of an internal investigation. Activision called off plans to hold its biggest annual convention, BlizzCon, in February. And Kotick agreed to cut his total compensation by 99.9%, to $62,500, until the company achieves goals on increasing diversity.On Tuesday, Kotick doubled down on his defense of the company’s action. In a video to employees seen by Bloomberg he said, “Anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming and inclusive workplace doesn’t really appreciate how important this is to me.” But Kotick’s efforts may be too little, too late. On Tuesday, a new shareholder suit filed accuses Activision Blizzard’s leadership of fostering and engendering “a culture that permitted rampant sexual and racial harassment and discrimination.”\\n\\nIt says the publisher’s directors and officers also failed to tell investors about state and federal investigations into its allegedly discriminatory workplace culture for more than two years, instead referencing “routine claims and lawsuits” in its securities filings, according to the partially redacted complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images One of the World’s Poorest Countries Found a Better Way to Do Stimulus Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",
       " 'Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) has observed multiple Iranian threat actors targeting the IT services sector in attacks that aim to steal sign-in credentials belonging to downstream customer networks to enable further attacks. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Security Unit (DSU) assess this as part of a broader spying objective to compromise organizations of interest to the Iranian regime. As India and other nations rise as major IT services hubs, more nation-state actors follow the supply chain to target these providers’ public and private sector customers worldwide, matching nation-state interests. Microsoft has issued over 1,600 notifications to over 40 IT companies in response to Iranian targeting, compared to 48 in 2020. The focus of several Iranian threat groups on the IT sector notably spiked in the last six months. Most of the targeting focuses on IT services companies based in India and several companies based in Israel and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. government, and counterparts in Australia and the U.K., warned that Iran-backed attackers have been exploiting Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ: FTNT) vulnerabilities since at least March and a Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability since October, TechCrunch reported. The attackers aimed to gain access to U.S. critical infrastructure organizations in the transport and public health sectors and organizations in Australia for follow-on operations like data exfiltration, extortion, and ransomware deployment.

He referred to the Wall Street Journal story earlier this week that said Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick knew of sexual harassment at the company for years and that he mistreated women.\\n\\n“This type of behavior has no place in our industry,” Spencer wrote. He joins a swell of outcry from employees to investors and shareholders in demanding a stronger response from the U.S.’s second-biggest gaming publisher. On Wednesday, Sony Group Corp.’s PlayStation Chief Jim Ryan sent a similar note to staff, writing that he and his leadership were “disheartened and frankly stunned to read” that Activision “has not done enough to address a deep-seated culture of discrimination and harassment.”\\n\\nBut Spencer went a step further in saying he would take action. Xbox and PlayStation are among the video game industry’s biggest console manufacturers. Activision has a long history with the Xbox. The publisher’s largest franchise, Call of Duty, became successful largely due to Microsoft’s innovative online platform Xbox Live, which allows players to connect for multiplayer matches. Most of Activision’s games are published on Xbox consoles.\\n\\nAt least 500 Activision employees have signed a petition to remove Kotick, and a shareholder group has called for him to resign and for two other long-serving directors to step down by the end of the year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs public backlash mounts, the company’s stock has taken a hit. JPMorgan Chase cut its recommendation on the stock, citing the growing controversy over Kotick. The “recent negative headlines introduce a significant amount of uncertainty into this story,” and it is unclear how long this issue will remain a risk,” JPMorgan analyst Alexia Quadrani wrote in a note to investors.\\n\\nActivision stock slid 3% on Thursday, bringing losses this week to more than 10%.\\n\\n(Updates with analyst downgrade in sixth paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed How Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in America First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS Google Wants to Save the Planet With Satellite Images Generation Lockdown: Where Youth Unemployment Has Surged\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",

The stock has gained nearly 10% in 2021 as it grappled with a re-opening economy, rising labor costs and supply chain disruptions. The benchmark index is up about 25%.\\n\\nDespite two consecutive quarters in which Amazon missed revenue estimates, all 60 analysts tracked by Bloomberg that cover the stock have maintained their buy ratings. That level of bullishness is unmatched by Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.\\n\\n“We see Amazon as a top pick on a 12-month view with an increasingly positive skew in its risk/reward after a pronounced period (16+ months) of share underperformance,” Sheridan and his colleagues wrote. Goldman’s $4,100 price target implies a gain of about 16% from current levels.\\n\\nPowerful Earnings\\n\\nThe tech sector as a whole has held up well in the past two weeks, despite a spike in U.S. Treasury yields. Rising yields tend to discount the present value of future profits and higher rates put pressure on the shares of technology companies with high valuations.\\n\\nA strong earnings season is one reason the sector has performed well, according to Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management. “Yes, they are facing higher rates, but they also have higher earnings, so I don’t think there will be a catastrophic effect,” Andersen said in an interview.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNvidia Corp.’s record quarterly sales on Wednesday evening confirmed that trend.

The world was being revolutionized by the Internet, dot-coms and technology companies.\\n\\nBy the late 1990s, the “tech titans” of Microsoft, Cisco, Intel and Dell were must-owns.\\n\\nMicrosoft MSFT\\xa0and Cisco CSCO\\xa0weren’t dot-coms that made no money. These companies were blue chips that made billions.\\n\\nInvestors poured money into their shares.\\n\\nFrom Jan 2, 1998 to Jan 3, 2000, Microsoft shares jumped 240%.\\n\\nDuring that same time, Cisco, which was one of the hottest stocks of the decade gaining over 10,000%, was up another 447%.\\n\\nBut these weren’t even the hottest tech companies.\\n\\nQUALCOMM QCOM\\xa0was a day-trader favorite. During those 2 years, QUALCOMM shares jumped 2216%.\\n\\nThe 2021 Bull Rally\\n\\nIn 2021, Microsoft is back in the game as one of the FANGMAN stocks. Over the last 2 years, Microsoft shares have gained 126.4%.\\n\\nAnd other Silicon Valley darlings are again in the spotlight.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nInstead of it being Cisco,\\xa0NVIDIA NVDA\\xa0is one of the fan favorites. Over the last 2 years, NVIDIA shares are up 486.8%.\\n\\nNVIDIA shares are trading with a forward P/E of 73.\\n\\nBut much like the late 1990s, who cares about P/Es? It’s all about the growth and innovation.\\n\\nAnd nothing says “innovation” as much as\\xa0Tesla TSLA. Not only is it in a new, emerging industry of electric vehicles, Tesla is also on the cutting edge of AI-technology.\\n\\nIn fact, many say Tesla isn’t a car company at all, it’s a technology company.\\n\\nTesla shares are up 1,367% over the last 2 years.\\n\\nTesla isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 169.\\n\\nIs There Anywhere to Hide During a Bubble?\\n\\nQUALCOMM investors thought they were geniuses in 2000.\\n\\nWouldn’t you?\\n\\nInstead, from 2000 to 2003, QUALCOMM shares fell 79%. Microsoft would not hit its 2000 highs again until 2013.\\n\\nBut no one can pick the top either. And no one can say whether Tesla, NVIDIA or Microsoft 2.0 are at the “top” again.\\n\\nWhat else should you know about stock bubbles and investing during them?\\n\\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\\n\\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT in her personal portfolio.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Big Stocks To Invest In.\\n\\nBig stocks, also known as large-cap stocks, are stocks with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more. There is also a subset of stocks under large-cap stocks. This subset is called mega-cap stocks with a market cap of $200 billion or more.\\n\\nOne index that tracks big stocks with largest market caps is S&P 100 - a subset of S&P 500. According to S&P Global, S&P 100 is designed to track 100 major blue chip companies in the United States. As of August 31, 2021, this index includes 101 stocks. The median total market capitalization in the index is at $165.466 billion billion with the smallest at $39.389 billion and the largest at $2.533 trillion.\\n\\nWhile S&P Global mentions sector representation or balance as one of the factors used to screen stocks for S&P 100, this index features an extensive number of tech companies. Information technology and communication services stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) account for 48.4% of all the stocks in the S&P 100. Consumer discretionary stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) account for an additional 13.3%.\\n\\nWhile stock valuations will change over time and the pandemic-era economic stimuli will come to an end, some of these companies have established themselves firmly as blue chip market leaders.\\n\\nPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWe chose some of the most famous large-cap stocks based on the data of 873 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\\n\\nWhy should we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment during stock selection? Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 86 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and July 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 186.1%, vs. 100.1% for the SPY[see details here]. We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) is an American company known for its electric vehicles as well as its energy business selling solar energy and battery energy storage products. It is ranked twelfth on our list of 12 best big stocks to invest in. The stock has returned over 123% to investors over the course of the past year.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $9.30 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA).\\n\\nOut of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has the most valuable stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) as of the end of the second quarter of 2021, worth close to $3.69 billion, comprising 6.87% of its 13F portfolio.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, Worm Capital LLC, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here is what the firm had to say:\\n\\n“Tesla underperformed in the quarter, but we maintain our high conviction in the long-term thesis on each business model. Much like art or writing, investment research is a continuous process—it never really ends. Prices can move in either direction in any given quarter, but our advantage often comes from knowing the businesses so well that short-term fluctuations in pricing shouldn’t affect our decision-making. On high conviction positions, this patience is often rewarded, which is why research is so valuable to our process…\\n\\n..Tesla is in a class of its own. What many in the market seem to (still) not understand is that Tesla is not a car company so much as a complex manufacturing firm—with significant recurring software potential—growing, in our view, at a targeted rate of 50-100% YoY over the next several years. Unlike any other automotive firm in existence today, Tesla alone is a vertically integrated hardware and software business developing state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques that will revolutionize the auto industry (i.e. its Giga Presses, 4680 cells, etc.). It is a generational company and we anticipate it will eventually be the largest company in the world. Many of the conventional narratives around competition displacing Tesla’s lead are fundamentally flawed, and the many headlines surrounding Tesla’s approach to autonomy are frustratingly superficial. (As an aside, we highly recommend watching Andrej Karpathy’s, Tesla’s head of AI, his recent presentation from June: “Tesla details its self-driving Supercomputer that will bring in the Dojo era”)”\\n\\n11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\\n\\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is an American retailer corporation known for its hypermarkets across North America. It is the largest retailer in the United States and the world's largest company by revenue.

(NASDAQ: FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), investors are paying attention to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) amid the company's long-term growth potential.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, Baron Opportunity Fund mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here is what the fund had to say:\\n\\n“NVIDIA Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing chips. Shares of NVIDIA rose in the second quarter on financial results and guidance significantly above Street expectations, as it benefited from the upgrade cycle in its gaming franchise along with continued AI-related strength driving its data center segment. NVIDIA’s total revenues of $5.66 billion beat Street expectations by $266 million, growing 84% (including the benefit of acquisitions, 65% organic), with its gaming business growing over 100% and its data center business expanding nearly 80%. We remain confident in NVIDIA’s leading position in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines.”\\n\\n9. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is a New Jersey-based multinational corporation with products and services in pharmaceutical, consumer health, and medical devices. It is ranked ninth on our list of 12 best big stocks to invest in. The stock has returned over 17.04% to investors over the course of the past year.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.06 billion in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), up from 81 the preceding quarter worth $6.91 billion.\\n\\nOut of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Fundsmith LLP has the most valuable stake in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) as of the end of the second quarter of 2021, worth close to $1.18 billion, comprising 3.26% of its 13F portfolio.\\n\\n8.

Fisher Asset Management's stake increased by 4% during the second quarter of 2021.\\n\\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) is an American multinational holding company founded and managed by Warren Buffett, one of the most notable investors of all times.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, 116 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $22.38 billion in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B), up from 111 the preceding quarter worth $19.9 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Vltava Fund, an investment management firm, mentioned Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B). Here is what the firm had to say:\\n\\n“Despite the considerable rise in stock markets over the past year, there are still many attractive opportunities. Human nature also is playing a bit into our hands. Investor crowds often chase popular stocks, hot IPOs, or mysterious SPACs and completely leave aside stocks they consider boring and not sexy enough. A typical example of this category is our long-term largest position in Berkshire Hathaway. Since we bought it for the first time, its price has nearly quadrupled and yet it remains just as undervalued today as it was at that time. Considering the current rate at which it is buying back its own shares and the amount of cash that Berkshire Hathaway has, my greatest wish as a shareholder is for the company’s share price to remain as low as possible for as long as possible.”\\n\\n6.

       " 'The market rally is sending mixed messages, with President Biden about to make his Fed chief pick. Is it time to buy Rivian stock?',\n",
       " 'In 2021, U.S. stocks have rallied hard and they have rallied fast, with the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq each looking to notch another double-digit gain for the year.\\n\\nIt’s an incredible surge, and indicates how confident we’ve become as the economy reopens and recovers. The labor market continues to improve as well, with initial jobless claims now falling close to pre-pandemic levels and October’s jobs report showing a strong snap back in payrolls. And consumers, despite feeling the pressure of inflation and the supply chain crisis, continue to be resilient.\\n\\nWhile we can’t predict what the market will do tomorrow, we can try our best to hedge against broader economic risks by investing in quality dividend-paying stocks.\\n\\nBut how do you find them?\\n\\nSmarter Dividend Investing\\n\\nThere’s no perfect equation for stock picking. If there was, we’d all be living our best lives somewhere in a tropical paradise. But what we can do instead is rely on a few things: growth fundamentals, future (and past) performance, valuation, and a dash of gut feeling.\\n\\nWith dividend investing, goals will be a bit different compared to other strategies. Income investors are in it for the long haul, and are buying and holding stocks to receive those coveted quarterly payouts. Because who doesn’t love a little bit of extra cash, am I right?\\n\\nFirst, you should pinpoint what, exactly, you’re investing for. Is it for retirement, long-term savings, starting a new business, or general wealth building? Having a goal for your money will make you more attuned to your investments.\\n\\nOnce you have that locked down, you can start filtering for top performing dividend stocks.\\n\\nTypically, you’ll find that mature, profitable companies are the ones shelling out stable dividends; these businesses—think utilities, telecoms, consumer staples, insurance companies—have hit a certain point in their growth cycle where they’re unable to grow at the rate they once did. Because of this, companies in these sectors are able to distribute their profits as dividends.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSometimes, you’ll even be able to discover a dividend-paying stock in a flashier sector. Take Microsoft MSFT, for example. Microsoft began paying a dividend in 2004, which at that point the tech company was in a period of stagnation where it didn’t need to reinvest its earnings to fuel high growth. Now, of course, Microsoft is one of the sector’s leading cloud and software players, and pays a dividend with a yield of 0.73%.\\n\\nAs for fundamentals, there are key metrics that income investors should pay attention to.\\n\\nThe dividend yield is something that many investors, not just income, look at, since it tells you how much income you will receive relative to the price of the stock. While a high dividend yield will provide a good source of income, it could also signal that the stock may not make a good investment; the company’s financial health and future growth is likely in question if it’s paying an ultra-high yield.\\n\\nDividend investors should also look at what’s known as the “payout ratio.”\\n\\nThis ratio, which is the percentage of profits that a company spends on dividends, is going to tell you if a company is paying out\\xa0too much of its profits on dividends. Generally, you should probably look at dividend paying stocks that pay out no more than 60% of their earnings, though if you are interested in investing in REITs, you’ll find their payout ratios to be at least 90%, as this is required.\\n\\nWhat about growth?\\n\\nLooking at a company’s annualized dividend growth rate, as well as its average annual dividend increase over a five-year period, will help show you how much a company is growing its dividend over time. Plus, future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth, so your stock picks will need to have strong year-over-year earnings growth rates, too.\\n\\nYou can also check out the list of companies known as the Dividend Aristocrats for portfolio inspiration. These companies have a strong history of profit growth, and have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\\n\\nWhen looking for dividend stocks, always remember this: companies aren’t obligated to pay dividends, and if a company cuts its dividend, that’s when you know there’s trouble on the horizon.\\n\\n2 Dividend Stocks to Consider\\n\\nWith all of this in mind, let’s take a look at some dividend stocks that could make good “buy-and-hold” additions to your portfolio.\\n\\nSeagate Technology STX\\n\\nSeagate is a digital memory stock that designs, manufactures, and markets a range of rigid disc drive products that are used in mainframes, workstations, and enterprise-level servers.\\n\\nSeagate recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter results. Revenue jumped 35% year-over-year to $3.12 billion, while adjusted earnings more than doubled compared to last year. Seagate’s HDD product lineup has helped keep net income, profit margins, and free cash flow on the rise for a while now, and demand should remain strong—especially now that STX launched new technology that integrates its HDDs with the PCIe interface—as more and more people work remotely.\\n\\nSTX has a solid yield of 2.65%, with a payout ratio of 40%. Seagate is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. Shares are cheap too, trading at a forward P/E of 13.3X compared to the Technology Services Market (roughly 70X). Plus, STX offers a more enticing yield than what the S&P 500 Index would provide you.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase JPM\\n\\nJPMorgan is the biggest bank in the U.S., and was the top-performing large bank over the past decade. Additionally, JPM outperformed its peers during the pandemic recession last year, falling only 5% in 2020 while other banks experienced double-digit percentage drops.\\n\\nThere are two key things that set JPMorgan apart from other banks, the first being its “fortress balance sheet,” according to CEO Jamie Dimon. The company ended 2020 with capital reserves above $200 billion, which will provide the means to both invest in its business and return money to shareholders. The second factor is JPMorgan’s diverse revenue stream, which helps offset any tough economic periods.\\n\\nJPM, a #3 (Hold) stock, is about as stable as it gets in the financial sector. It has a forward P/E of only 13.4X, trading competitively below peers in the Finance Market (17.5X) considering its short- and long-term growth potential. Additionally, JPM has one of the best dividends in the space, with an annual yield of 2.45% and a payout ratio of 23.4%.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       " \"The holidays are coming, and that means you’re probably hoping to score deals on the hottest gadgets — either for gifts for your loved ones, or let’s face it, yourself.\\n\\nBut contrary to what some retailers and manufacturers may want you to think, you should avoid buying certain tech items on Black Friday. What’s more, waiting until Black Friday this year might actually be a disadvantage when it comes to shopping for the hottest items.\\n\\nWant to make sure you’re not tossing your hard-earned cash in the trash, or missing out on the best sales? I’ve got you covered.\\n\\nStop waiting and start shopping\\n\\nMost people wait to buy their holiday gifts until around Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Retailers have some of their top sales of the year, and it’s often hard to resist snagging something you’ve been eyeing for months at a seriously low price.\\n\\nBut as you’ve probably heard ad nauseam since last year, we’re living in unprecedented times. The pandemic shut down large swaths of the global supply chain, just as consumers started clamoring for new gadgets, creating a chip shortage expected to last well into 2022 at best.\\n\\n“The biggest issue this year is that there's no guarantee that if you want something in particular that it will be available,” explained NerdWallet personal finance expert Kimberly Palmer. “So you don't want to wait this year. You want to start shopping early.”\\n\\nDon’t have time to shop until you’re still digesting your Thanksgiving dinner on Black Friday? We’ve got you covered with some shopping tips.\\n\\nThose TVs deals aren’t always worth it, especially this year\\n\\nNothing says Black Friday more than hordes of shoppers scrambling to get their mitts on deeply discounted TVs. But I’ve always been of the mind that TVs aren’t actually worth grabbing during the holiday shopping season. And I’m not alone.\\n\\n“TVs are one to watch out for on Black Friday,” said Kristin McGrath, editor of The Real Deal by RetailMeNot.\\n\\n“Black Friday TV deals are obviously famous, and they're a huge tradition. But a lot of retailers put their lowest prices on these cheap models.”\\n\\nStory continues Advertisements of the upcoming Black Friday sales are seen on TV screens at a Walmart store in Westminster, Colorado, U.S. November 23, 2016. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\\n\\nIn other words, the TVs you see on sale aren’t the best on the market. You’re not going to see incredibly deep discounts on sets that have the latest and greatest features like high refresh rates or OLED screens. Instead, you’ll see either last year’s models or models that have been pushed out specifically for Black Friday sales.\\n\\nBesides, holding off a few months to buy a new TV could pay off handsomely.\\n\\n“If you're trying to get a nice TV that's going to last you a while and you don't want to replace it in another couple years, I would say shopping right before the Super Bowl is a better time,” McGrath said.\\n\\nPart of the reason for that is that manufacturers debut their latest models during the annual CES electronics convention in Las Vegas. Retailers, anticipating those units, use the Super Bowl to push last year’s sets out the door, meaning great discounts for shoppers.\\n\\nSuper cheap computers are a waste\\n\\nI used to work at a big box electronics retailer. Let’s say its name rhymes with Test...Guy. Anyway, people always ran in on Sundays to snag the cheapest laptop on sale. But those systems would invariably be underpowered and need to be replaced in short order. Over the long term, it would be more expensive to keep buying low-powered computers than holding off and buying a more powerful system.\\n\\nBlack Friday is like that scenario on steroids. The incredibly inexpensive laptops that you see on sale are likely the ones that are going to be outdated quickly, if they aren’t already. Black Friday shoppers check out Apple laptops on sale on Black Friday, at the Fair Lakes Best Buy store in Fairfax, Virginia. AFP PHOTO Paul J. RICHARDS (Photo credit should read PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean you won’t find good laptops and desktops on sale, though. There are sure to be solid systems that you can get at a discount, but they’re not going to go for the super low prices you see as part of doorbuster deals. Like TVs, if you’re looking to save on laptops and desktops, your smartest move is to make sure that you check out the specs.\\n\\nI suggest anything running an Intel (INTC) Core i5 processor and at least 8GB of RAM is a good benchmark for a system that will last you some time. It’s not going to be the Ferrari of PCs — more like a Toyota Camry. Relatively inexpensive, not too flashy, and efficient.\\n\\nGame consoles are going to be hard to get\\n\\nIf you’ve got a gamer in your life who wants a PlayStation 5, an Xbox Series X or Series S, or a Nintendo Switch OLED, you better put their expectations in check.\\n\\nBoth the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles have been hard to come by ever since they launched last year, and the chip crisis and supply chain woes haven’t made things any better. I actually tried getting a PS5 for a friend while writing this article when I saw a notification about available consoles on Twitter. And by the time I got to the site, they were sold out. Japanese video gaming system brand created and owned by Sony Computer Entertainment, PlayStation 5, is seen at its official store in Hong Kong. (Photo by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nYou can find consoles on secondary marketplaces like eBay (EBAY) and through third-party sellers on Amazon and Walmart.com, but you’ll have to pay hundreds over their actual retail prices. If you’re not one to give up so easily, though, McGrath says retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) will have the consoles online on Black Friday. But keep in mind, you’ll be fighting everyone else on the internet trying to get a limited number of systems. So don’t bet on it.\\n\\nGet headphones\\n\\nHeadphones actually make for a solid buy during Black Friday and Cyber Monday — heck, throughout the holiday shopping season. There’s no real guessing game when it comes to the specs of some of the most well-known headphones. No figuring out if they have a particular processor or not. It’s essentially about whether you get earbuds or over-the-ear headphones, and if they include active-noise cancelling technology. Apple's Airpods. (Photo by Chukrut Budrul/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nI know a few people looking for Apple's (AAPL) AirPods, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel Buds, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds this shopping season, and I’d advise them to jump on any deals they see. Apple recently released its third-generation AirPods with improved audio capabilities, and Beats launched its Beats Fit Pro; both are excellent earbuds and worth checking out.\\n\\nIf you can get them, go for them.\\n\\nDiscounts on services cards\\n\\nLooking for a quick, easy tech gift that won’t sell out for the holidays? Yes, it exists, and it’s gift cards. Specifically, gift cards for services like Netflix (NFLX), Sony (SONY) PlayStation Plus, and Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox Game Pass. There are a slew of other available options for different video and music streaming, and game services, and you don’t have to worry about them going out of stock.\\n\\nThe discounts on Xbox Game Pass are my personal favorite. The service is already a ridiculous deal at $14.99 per month for more than 100 games that you can play as you want and with included cloud gaming. But during the holiday shopping season you can get cards worth three months of service at steep discounts. It depends on the retailer you choose, but some will sell them for as little as $1.\\n\\nI’d say that’s a solid deal.\\n\\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\\n\\nMore from Dan\\n\\nNvidia’s latest earnings report is the ‘nail in the coffin’ for $40 billion ARM deal: Analyst Nvidia CEO Huang: AI is the 'most powerful technology force the world has known' Nvidia CEO: ‘We don’t have any magic bullets’ to deal with chip shortage\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\\n\\nGot a tip?

       " 'Nvidia’s (NVDA) $40 billion deal to purchase the U.K.-based chip developer ARM from SoftBank is all but dead. That’s at least what Susquehanna senior equity analyst Chris Rolland took away from Nvidia’s leadership during the company’s Q3 earnings call on Wednesday.\\n\\n“I think some of the commentary [on Wednesday] kind of puts the final nail in the ARM coffin here,” Rolland told Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nNvidia initially made the $40 billion deal public in September 2020 with expectations that it would be finalized within 18 months, or the first quarter or 2022. During the company’s earnings call, however, it laid out the huge regulatory obstacles it needs to clear including enhanced regulatory scrutiny in the U.K, where ARM is based. The U.S., E.U., and China would also have to approve the deal.\\n\\n\"Regulators in the U.K. and the EU declined to approve the transaction in Phase 1 of their review processes, expressed numerous concerns, began a more in-depth Phase 2 review on the transaction’s impact on competition, and, in the UK, a Phase 2 review of the impact on the UK’s national security interests,\" the company said in a statement following its earnings report.\\n\\n\"Although regulators and some ARM licensees have expressed concerns or objected to the transaction, we continue to believe in the merits and benefits of the acquisition to ARM, its licensees, and the industry.\"\\n\\nTech industry players including Microsoft (MSFT), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have pushed back against the proposed deal.\\n\\nARM licenses its designs and software to third parties including Qualcomm, Apple, Google, and Nvidia, which use those designs to develop their own custom chips. ARM is widely considered a neutral player in the tech industry, because it partners with such a diverse array of companies. Think of it as the tech world’s Switzerland.\\n\\nThe fear is that if Nvidia purchases ARM, that neutrality will fade away. Nvidia, however, has pushed back against that claim.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“The benefit of ARM being part of Nvidia is that we could accelerate their R&D scale,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. “ARM, as you know, are quite successful in mobile devices. But we could help them be much more successful in all other areas of computing.”\\n\\nIf the deal is done for, as Rolland says, investors aren’t bothered. Shares of Nvidia jumped more than 8% on Thursday following the company’s blockbuster Q3 earnings report, during which Nvidia announced revenue grew by 50% year-over-year.\\n\\n“It was already [baked] in the stock, the fact that this deal is not going to happen,” Rolland said.\\n\\nIt’s not as though Nvidia hasn’t worked with ARM in the past and won’t in the future, either. As Rolland points out, Nvidia previously built out its own ARM-based server. And its Tegra CPU is the ARM-based chip that powers Nintendo’s Switch console.\\n\\n“They could license this, and they have had some success in the past on the CPU front,” he said.\\n\\nAs for Nvidia’s ability to deal with the ongoing chip shortage and global supply chain crunch, Rolland says Nvidia is far better off than other chipmakers.\\n\\n“Nvidia is in a very fortunate position, particularly versus its peers. And that’s because of its dual supply and sourcing strategy. They hit both Samsung and TSMC foundries for supply and because of that it puts them in a much better position overall,” Rolland said.\\n\\nStill, that doesn’t mean Nvidia chips will be easier to get anytime soon. According to Huang, the chip shortage will constrain supply through the next year.\\n\\nAs for Nvidia’s sky-high valuation — the company’s price to earnings ratio stands at 113.45% for the trailing 12 months — Rolland says it’s largely justified.\\n\\n“This is a company that has been consistently beating and raising and working into the multiple and taking massive share in potentially huge markets,\" he said, \"and that is what the excitement around the stock is all about.”\\n\\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\\n\\nMore from Dan\\n\\nNvidia CEO Huang: AI is the \\'most powerful technology force the world has known\\' Nvidia CEO: ‘We don’t have any magic bullets’ to deal with chip shortage Nvidia is on top of the world, but its rivals are gaining steam\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\\n\\nGot a tip?

And as you know, with Amazon Go, you don't have to actually check these items out.\\n\\nThe Amazon app just knows. They got some tricky little cameras in there that can track you. Even if you put it back on the shelf, it knows. So combining all this technology, I see this as the future of retail.\\n\\nAnd you look at the structure of some of these partnerships, Amazon joining with Starbucks, Amazon just dumped Visa for Mastercard. There's already a partnership in place between Starbucks, Microsoft Intercontinental Exchange. That's the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, [INAUDIBLE].\\n\\nYou put all these together. And I think we're seeing a group of very strong companies that are going to be partnering in the future. So I wouldn't be surprised to see some kind of Microsoft announcement as well. And if Amazon ever does crypto, I think they're going to go with probably [INAUDIBLE], because that's who they already have the partnership with [INAUDIBLE] Mastercard.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 New Stock Picks of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.\\n\\nIn May this year, Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief of Duquesne Capital, had warned that the stimulus efforts of the Federal Reserve were inflating a massive asset bubble and putting the status of the United States Dollar as the global reserve currency at risk. Earlier, the billionaire investor, during an interview with CNBC, had said that he expected to cash out on his equity investments in the near future, suggesting that cryptocurrencies could soon usurp the dollar in value across the world, with Bitcoin, the most popular coin, leading this revolution.\\n\\nDruckenmiller recently attended the Boston Investment Conference and outlined his thoughts on the overall market situation, saying that there was a massive bubble around crypto, meme stocks, and art. The investor added that even though the bubble was paying off for a lot of “geniuses” in the short-term, it would prove to be a “disaster” for them in the long-term. Druckenmiller has a personal net worth of close to $7 billion and is widely respected in the finance world with regards to his expertise in growth sectors of the economy.\\n\\nInvestors who want further insight into the philosophy of Druckenmiller should check out his latest moves at the market. Securities filings show that Duquesne Capital had a portfolio value of $3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2021, down from $4 billion at the end of the second quarter. Between June and September, the fund made new purchases in 14 stocks, sold out of 14, made additional purchases in 9, and reduced holdings in 19 equities. Some of the top stocks in the portfolio included Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.

Confluent sells and distributes a commercialized version of open source software called Kafka created by former executives at LinkedIn. The solution allows enterprise users the ability to capture data in real time as it is streaming. A prime use case is capturing real-time inventory across retail stores and distribution centers to enable omni-channel commerce. We believe it is early days in the company’s commercialization of this technology which can capture data in both on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. Global-e Online, meanwhile, removes many of the frictions around cross-border ecommerce by handling the different tax structures, languages, currencies, local logistics and fulfillment/returns for any size retailer. The company’s initial customers have been mostly mid to higher end retailers but an investment by Shopify should enable Global-e to significantly increase merchant reach.”\\n\\n8. Fastly, Inc.

(NYSE:LYV) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“In 2006, we initiated our position in Live Nation, the global entertainment company that handles promotion, venue management and ticket sales for live events. Live Nation was spun out of the former Clear Channel Communications in late 2005. In our view, spinoffs often represent attractive opportunities because investors frequently undervalue the new company. We believed this was the case with Live Nation, especially given its initially small market capitalization. As well, when spinoffs are freed from their parents, they typically benefit from intensified management focus and more flexible capital allocation policies. In Live Nation’s case, the spinoff helped make possible the merger with Ticketmaster in 2010, which materially improved the business franchise. Although these factors alone might have made Live Nation a good holding for the Fund, an unexpected technology helped to boost the company’s fortunes: streaming. As the advantages of streaming convinced consumers to reduce or even eliminate their purchases of media, such as CDs and DVDs, artists began to tour more, thereby providing a tailwind to Live Nation’s operations. This accelerated growth in the company’s intrinsic value per share, which in turn generated numerous increases in our sell target for the holding, enabling us to continue to own the shares in the Fund for 14 years. We typically target a three- to five-year holding period for our equity investments, but we love opportunities like Live Nation, which achieve unanticipated intrinsic value growth.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 New Stock Picks of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now Stanley Druckenmiller is Selling These 12 Stocks 25 Coldest Countries in the World\\n\\nDisclosure.

PayPal is a pure play on e-commerce and electronic payments which is driving the company’s high unit volume growth. As a digital payments company, it is helping to facilitate the shift to a cashless society. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly accelerated the adoption of e-commerce and the utilization of digital payments platforms. In our view, PayPal is currently positioned to benefit the strength in e-commerce trends, including increasing net new active users and increased engagement per user. PayPal also has launched a service enabling its customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account. PayPal’s vision is to become a Super App that integrates payments, commerce and financial services, as well as crypto capabilities. After outperforming earlier in the year, the performance of PayPal shares weakened in the third quarter with the company facing potentially higher transaction expenses and credit losses.

Microsoft is a Positive Dynamic Change beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s enterprise cloud product, Azure, is rapidly growing and accruing market share. Microsoft reported that Azure grew 51% in the second quarter. This high unit volume growth is a primary driver of the company’s higher share price, but the company’s strong operating execution has enabled margin expansion that has also helped to increase forward earnings estimates. We believe Microsoft’s subscription-based software offerings and cloud computing services have a durable growth profile because they enhance customers’ growth initiatives and help them to diminish costs.

Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\\n\\nNucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is the largest steel producer in the U.S., specializing in structural steel, carbon steel plate, and sheet steel products. As of 2020, the company has over 26,000 employees. The stock has gained about 112% year to date.\\n\\nIn August, Argus lifted its price target on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) to $140, while keeping a ‘Buy’ rating on the shares. The firm’s analyst noted the company’s strong balance sheet and growth across its all segments. In Q2 2021, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) posted a GAAP EPS of $5.04, beating the estimates by $0.32.

These stakes are valued at over $196.4 million.\\n\\nMadison Funds mentioned Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) in its Q1 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“This quarter we are highlighting Nucor (NUE) as a relative yield example within the Materials sector. NUE is a leading manufacturer of steel and steel products. It is the largest steelmaker in the U.S. based on production volume with a vertically integrated business model. The company has a low fixed-cost position due to its use of electric arc furnaces, which are cleaner, less labor and energy-intensive than blast furnaces, and this results in low total costs per unit of steel produced. Our view is that a low cost position is an important attribute in a commodity business. NUE’s historical financial record supports this view as it has been profitable every year except for one over the past fifty years, unlike many steel producing peers. In addition, the company has a diverse product and mill portfolio that takes market share over time. We believe its scale, low fixed-cost position, consistent record of profitability and diverse mill portfolio result in a sustainable competitive advantage versus peers.\\n\\nOur thesis on NUE is that it should benefit from higher steel prices as the U.S. economy recovers from the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company may also be a beneficiary of on-shoring, where manufacturing returns to the United States. These two dynamics should drive growth this year, and if the United States Congress passes new infrastructure legislation, that will provide another avenue for growth longer-term.\\n\\nImportantly, NUE has a strong balance sheet and flexible capital spending model that can quickly adjust to changing economic\\n\\nconditions. If economic growth slows, NUE can quickly reduce its cost structure, something it has done successfully in prior cyclical downturns. The company has low financial leverage as its net debt/adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was only 0.9x at the end of last year, and it consistently generates positive free cash flow. These favorable characteristics differentiate NUE from other steel producers and help the company gain market share through disciplined capital allocation.\\n\\nThe fund purchased NUE at $56 in January, 2021, after it reached a low valuation with an attractive dividend yield and relative dividend yield versus the S&P 500. At the time or purchase, the stock yielded 3.3% and had a relative dividend yield of more than 2x the S&P 500, which was the high end of its historical range as shown in the bottom pane in the graph. The company is also a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its dividend annually for 48 years. We expect continued dividend increases going forward.\\n\\nRisks to the thesis include a prolonged economic downturn, lower steel prices and increasing steel import volumes that could hurt NUE financial performance. We believe these risks are manageable as economic growth is expected to be well above average this year. Specifically, Goldman Sachs is forecasting U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth of +8% in 2021, which would be the fastest pace of growth since 1950. Strong growth is likely to result in higher manufacturing activity, which we believe would be supportive of higher steel prices and limit risks to the thesis.”\\n\\n7. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\\n\\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest exploration and production companies engaged in the exploration of hydrocarbons. The company is the largest producer of crude oil in Alaska. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has a track record of 5 years of consistent dividend growth and pays an annual dividend of $1.84 per share. The stock's dividend yield currently stands at 2.51%.\\n\\nRecently, Royal Dutch Shell, a multinational oil and gas company, sold its Permian Basin Assets to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in a deal worth $9.5 billion. Through this deal, the company will be able to add nearly 200 MBoe/d of production. In September, Raymond James lifted its price target on ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to $90, while maintaining a ‘Strong Buy’ rating on the shares.\\n\\nThe firm’s analyst John Freeman appreciated the company’s acquisition of Shell’s Permian Basin Assets, which will allow the company to add approximately $1.9 billion in free cash flow for 2022. In Q3 2021, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) posted an EPS of $1.77, beating the estimates by $0.25. The company expects the total production to reach 1.48 to 1.52 MBoe/d in 2021.

Exxon Mobil recently lost a proxy fight with an activist investor that took three of the company’s 12 board seats.

Yields tanked on Friday, which helps relieve some of the pressure from inflation worries on those same sectors. However, Asian stocks were a little rough on Sunday night, and so far, the U.S. markets are still a little sluggish.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nDouble Your Money 8 Times, in 12 Months? I Say “Yes!”\\n\\nOne of the reasons for our cautious tone over the past few weeks is the odd price action we are seeing in the high-yield, or junk, bond market. Bond traders are a unique bunch, and they are laser-focused on risks to cash flow, so they often see things stock traders miss.\\n\\nSo when high-yield bond traders are selling and the S&P 500 is rising, we go on yellow alert. High-yield bonds fell all last week and look likely to continue.\\n\\nWe received a lot of questions about high-yield bonds and how they may predict market trends last week. So, we recorded a video to give you some ideas of what to look for and how these trends might influence your investing. Check that out on our YouTube channel here.\\n\\nCapitalizing on the Holidays with Continued Retail Opportunities\\n\\nEven in the best market conditions, however, this is usually a weird week for the market. As you can imagine, the offices and hallways of the big institutional firms start to look a little deserted around Tuesday afternoon as everyone sneaks out for Thanksgiving.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAnnouncing: The “Inflation Trade”\\n\\nVolume on Thanksgiving week is typically 40-60% below average. The same thing happens the week of Christmas, and to a lesser extent around the New Year.\\n\\nSo, what should you do?\\n\\nHonestly, there is a narrow window for traders this week to get into something good. Low volumes on Wednesday and Friday can make share price movements too random for our comfort level. We usually sit on the sidelines during the last half of a holiday week so we don’t get snagged by a whipsaw.\\n\\nHowever, if you missed some of the best stocks last week, we still think there are likely to be some good dip-buying opportunities on Monday and Tuesday if conditions improve, especially in retail:\\n\\nThe Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO): The drop in yields should be a big boost for Coke because the stock is valued based on its dividend. Lower rates are good for dividend payers because bonds are less attractive as an alternative. Any dips into the $52-53 range look good for new entries. Target Corp. (NASDAQ:TGT): Despite killing expectations and upping their forecast for the holiday season, Target took a hit last week. This is not uncommon; traders are known to “sell the news” following an earnings report, no matter how good it is. The upshot here is that any entries in the $240 to $250 range are getting the stock at essentially a discount.\\n\\nStill get trading ideas from Reddit? There’s a much better way…\\n\\nWill “Pandemic Stocks” Make a Comeback?\\n\\nThis is also a good time to address the issue of rising COVID rates in Europe and Asia because that comes with fears of lockdowns.\\n\\nIn our view, although rising cases are a tragedy, the rate of change hasn’t accelerated to the point that we are worried about stocks in general.\\n\\nDoes this mean “pandemic stocks” will surge again? Probably not. Stocks like Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) or Chegg Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) may attract some buying interest this month, but those bubbles popped fast, and traders are going to remember that.\\n\\nAvoid This Mistake AND Get $1,375 Instant Cash Payouts?\\n\\nHowever, there were a few quasi-pandemic stocks that have done a great job of capitalizing on economic growth as well as distance work, learning, collaboration, and shopping that could still be very interesting.\\n\\nIn that respect, we still like Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) — especially before retail sales reports start to stream in after the long weekend.\\n\\nOn Friday, we’re going to do something a little different. We’ve teased it here and there over the last few weeks, but we’re going to reveal the top five income stocks on our 2022 watchlist.\\n\\nStay tuned.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJohn Jagerson & Wade Hansen\\r\\n Editors, Trading Opportunities\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nStock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Now Man Who Called Black Monday: “Prepare Now.” #1 EV Stock Still Flying Under the Radar Interested in Crypto?

       " 'Data center real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) stock are a hot ticket right now. CyrusOne (NASDAQ:CONE) was bought out by private equity, led by KKR (NYSE:KKR), or Coresite Realty (NYSE:COR) which is being bought by American Tower (NYSE:AMT). corporate building with Equinix (EQIX) logo on it\\n\\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nEarlier this year, QTS Realty Trust was taken out by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX). One writer has asked if the days of publicly owned data REITs are numbered, because they’re highly prized.\\n\\nOn Nov. 19, Equinix shares were selling for $788 each. That’s a market capitalization of $70.9 billion on expected revenue of just $6.5 billion. The price to earnings ratio was 167 and the once-generous $11.48/year dividend yielded just 1.43%.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nWhy should you consider buying this pearl of great price?\\n\\nREIT for the Home Team\\n\\nA REIT is designed to buy assets for debt and deliver profits in the form of dividends. Many REITs have been poor investments lately. If you own a lot of commercial real estate, or office buildings, you have faced the pandemic and the new normal of less office space and more online sales.\\n\\n7 Stocks to Watch Now as Consumer Prices Spike\\n\\nBut data center REITs are an exception. Their fates are tied to the computing business, specifically cloud computing. They offer hosting for corporate computing, with a nexus to the clouds. They also offer places for cloud networks to intersect.\\n\\nThis means they don’t just benefit from the growth of the cloud czars, like Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They also win with every organization that chooses to co-locate their data on the information superhighway.\\n\\nEquinix earned $233 million in 2017, and this year, it earned nearly twice that at$428 million. In addition, it doesn’t have to face the technology costs of its tenants — it’s just selling space, connectivity, and physical security. It’s still a real estate business, but one tied to a booming industry.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPrivate Equity Wants\\n\\nEquinix has all the things a private equity buyer wants in an asset. Unlike the Cloud Czars it serves, it’s not investing cash flow, but buying debt. It’s taking few risks beyond the real estate it buys, just like a warehouse, but one with enormous value and rents to match. It also retains all the tax advantages of real estate, which is why a company with other profitable operations might find it irresistible.\\n\\nQTS, CoreSite and CyrusOne were all vulnerable to takeover because of their size. They could be bought for around $10 billion but Equinix, which has been selling co-location for decades now, is worth over $71 billion. Its primary competitor, Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), is worth $46.3 billion.\\n\\nIt’s possible Equinix could be bought, but it would be a heavy lift. What you’re buying with Equinix is the dividend, which was $1.75 per share each quarter five years ago and is now $2.87 per share. You’re also targeting those capital gains.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nREITs are part of the ballast you want once you have a substantial portfolio. They protect against inflation, because they’re real estate, but their capital gains are often meager.\\n\\nThat’s not the case with Equinix, and other data center REITs. While the average S&P 500 stock is up 115% over the last five years, Equinix is up 132%.\\n\\nYou will find volatility with Equinix because shares rise and fall sharply, although usually to higher lows and higher highs. The shares were over $882 in September, but at $610 in March.\\n\\nIf you need the kind of ballast real estate gives you, now might be a good time to get in. The charts are bearish over the short and medium term.\\n\\nBuy it low, and let it sit. I think you’ll be glad you did.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in AMZN and MSFT.

       " 'Kevin O\\'Leary says the \\'real opportunity\\' for Bitcoin will come from this overlooked group of investors — but he\\'s still a big fan of blue chip income stocks\\n\\nInvestment mogul and Shark Tank personality Kevin O’Leary isn’t shy about his fondness for cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nMost recently, he highlighted the ‘“real” opportunity when it comes to fueling the rise of Bitcoin over the long term: sovereign funds in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n“They have not allocated to crypto yet,” O’Leary said in an interview with Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano. “When that happens, you’ll see it reflected in the price of Bitcoin. There’s no question about it.”\\n\\nO’Leary pegged the opportunity in the “billions and billions and billions” of dollars.\\n\\nThat said, O’Leary’s biggest investment fund, O’Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, doesn’t invest in crypto at all — instead, it seeks businesses with strong profitability, balance sheets, and dividend growth.\\n\\nWhile Bitcoin is certainly becoming mainstream, it’s still important to maintain ample diversification with income-producing stocks.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at the top three holdings of O’Leary’s flagship fund. One (or all) of these dividend picks might be worth purchasing with your extra change.\\n\\nHome Depot Sundry Photography/Shutterstock\\n\\nHome Depot isn’t nearly as exciting as crypto, but it’s the top holding at OUSA, accounting for 6% of the fund’s weight.\\n\\nThe home improvement retail giant has around 2,300 stores, with each one averaging approximately 105,000 square feet of indoor retail space — a size that dwarfs most of its competitors.\\n\\nOne thing that makes Home Depot stand out is how well it performed during the pandemic.\\n\\nMany brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled since the beginning of COVID-19. Yet Home Depot grew its sales nearly 20% in fiscal 2020 to $132.1 billion.\\n\\nIt even boosted its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this year and now yields 1.6%.\\n\\nShares aren’t cheap, though.\\n\\nAfter rallying more than 55% year to date, Home Depot trades at over $410 per share. But you can get a piece of the company using a popular stock trading app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMicrosoft Volodymyr Kyrylyuk/Shutterstock\\n\\nTech stocks aren’t known for their dividends, but software gorilla Microsoft is an exception.\\n\\nThe company announced an 11% increase to its quarterly dividend to 62 cents per share a few months ago. Over the past five years, its payout has grown by 59%.\\n\\nSo it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Microsoft is the second-largest holding in O’Leary’s OUSA.\\n\\nBusiness has been booming of late, largely helped by the pandemic-fueled demand for its cloud-computing and video gaming offerings.\\n\\nIn the most recent quarter, Microsoft\\'s total revenue grew 22% to $45.3 billion while net income surged 48% to $20.5 billion.\\n\\nYear to date, Microsoft shares have returned a whopping 55%, easily topping other trillion-dollar tech giants like Apple (22%) and Amazon (13%).\\n\\nOf course, if you’re on the fence about jumping into tech stocks near all-time highs, some investing apps might give you a free share of Apple just for signing up.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson Golden Shrimp/Shutterstock\\n\\nWith deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, Johnson & Johnson has been able to deliver remarkably consistent returns to investors through thick and thin.\\n\\nNot only does Johnson & Johnson post recurring profits year in and year out, but it grows them consistently, as well: Over the last 20 years, Johnson & Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.\\n\\nThat said, management is shaking things up to extract even more value for shareholders.\\n\\nThe company recently announced plans to spin off its consumer health segment into a separate company in order to unlock value. Once the split is complete, investors will be given shares in both companies and, in turn, receive dividend payments from both stocks.\\n\\nWith the spinoff looming and the shares currently offering a decent dividend yield of 2.6%, Johnson & Johnson looks like a particularly timely opportunity.\\n\\nThe company is the third-largest holding in OUSA with a weighting of 4.7%.\\n\\nO’Leary’s other ‘fine’ asset Giorgiolo/Shutterstock\\n\\nGold, crypto, and common stocks aren’t the only things you’ll find in Mr. Wonderful’s portfolio.\\n\\nHe also utilizes a \"private\" way to diversify and to profit.\\n\\nIf you want to invest in something that has very little correlation with the violent swings of the stock and crypto market, consider this overlooked asset.\\n\\nInvesting in this real asset used to be an option only for the ultra-rich like O’Leary. But with a new investing platform, you can take a stake in it, too.\\n\\nAccording to the Citi Global Art Market chart, it has has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years.\\n\\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Cooperman said that an income of $400,000 did not make someone rich and the plan was meant to “attack billionaires”.\\n\\nCooperman has a personal net worth of $2.5 billion and has been the manager of one of the most successful hedge funds on Wall Street for more than three decades now. The investing strategy of the billionaire is based on value stocks that are judged against the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. Cooperman converted his fund into a family office in 2018 after several years of success.\\n\\nSome of the top stocks in the investment portfolio of Omega Advisors at the end of the third quarter of 2021 included Amazon.com, Inc.

In early March, Credit Suisse announced they were suspending redemptions on the bank’s investment funds related to Greensill’s trade finance business. Then, in late March, the bank announced that it had exposure to the family office Archegos. We believe that of all Wall Street banks, Credit Suisse had the worst response managing the risk presented by Archegos. The combination of these two events in the same month made it clear that the bank does not have adequate risk controls.\\n\\nWe sold our position in Credit Suisse in late March, ending a three-year period of holding shares in the company. Our investment thesis had been Credit Suisse 1) was a global wealth management franchise with an attractive growth rate, 2) had a low-risk, highly profitable domestic Swiss banking franchise, 3) had reduced capital intensity and volatility in the investment bank, and 4) traded for just 75% of tangible book and 8x forward earnings. We believe the bank will be in the penalty box with investors for multiple years due to these risk management failures. We view this situation as similar to Wells Fargo’s account opening scandal from four years ago. Wells Fargo has underperformed the S&P 1500 Financials Index by 95% during that.

He founded AQR Capital Management in 1998, a hedge fund focused on factor-based strategies for bolstering a quantitative approach to investing. Asness, now 55 and worth around $1.4 billion, earned dual degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in Computer Science and Economics, as well as a Ph.D. in Finance from the University of Chicago. Before founding AQR Capital, he worked on Goldman Sachs Asset Management's quantitative research desk, where he developed and used computer-driven models to beat the market.\\n\\nAs of September, AQR Capital Management managed more than $164 billion in assets, and its 13F securities portfolio was worth $53.9 billion. The firm's securities portfolio includes thousands of small and large cap stocks, and we will review the top 10 stocks under $20 out of them.\\n\\nThe most notable stocks in Cliff Asness' portfolio under $20 include Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE:FNB), CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:CX), Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX), and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI).\\n\\nIn addition to investing in stocks under $20, which give investors the chance to buy shares in bulk, the quant fund's strategy of investing in high-quality companies and holding them for a long time has also led to massive gains. For instance, Cliff Asness has owned stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) since 2004, which means that AQR capital management benefited from the tech giants' spectacular share price gains and dividend returns.\\n\\nAs of September, the firm owned stakes worth almost $1.90 billion in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and $1.7 billion in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLet's start digging into billionaire Cliff Asness' portfolio to review 10 stocks under $20. For this article, we made use of AQR Capital Management’s 13F portfolio as of September to pick 10 stocks under $20.

(NYSE:CX) gained upside momentum this year amid economic recovery and improvement in infrastructure activities. The stock price of CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:CX) is currently trading around $6, with a market cap of over $9 billion. Its top line grew 8% year over year in the September quarter, driven by robust demand across all products. Moving ahead, CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:CX) anticipates booming residential sector will fuel cement and other construction products demand.\\n\\nCEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:CX) was in 23 hedge funds’ portfolios as of June. Howard Marks' Oaktree Capital Management was the leading stakeholder in Cemex SAB de CV (NYSE:CX) with a stake worth $175 million.\\n\\n9. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)\\n\\nAQR Capital Management's Stake Value: $23.4 million\\n\\nPercentage of AQR Capital Management's 13F Portfolio: 0.04%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\\n\\nAQR Capital lifted its position by 103% in Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) during the September quarter. The firm’s strategy appears to be working because energy companies like Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) have been benefiting from strengthening oil demand and increasing prices since the beginning of this year. The share price of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is up 35% in the last six months, enlarging year-to-date gains to over 140%. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) also offers a dividend yield of over 1.12%.

Corporation (NYSE:FNB) by 38% in the September quarter. F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE:FNB), which is ranked eighth on the list of 10 stocks under $20, is a good stock to hold for the long term due to its healthy dividend yield of 3.86%. Moreover, the share price of F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE:FNB) is up 30% since the beginning of this year. F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE:FNB) also looks financially strong with record revenue of $321 million in the third quarter.\\n\\nLike AQR Capital, Matthew Lindenbaum’s Basswood Capital and Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies are among the leading stakeholders in F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE:FNB). The number of long hedge funds’ positions in F.N.B. Corporation (NYSE:FNB) stood at 16 as of June, according to data tracked by Insider Monkey.\\n\\n7.

However, following the recent dip, Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX) appears like one of the best stocks to own under $20 as AQR has a $30 million stake in the company as of the third quarter. Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX) posted revenue of $1.76 billion in the third quarter and expects full-year revenue in the range of $7.1 billion.\\n\\nXerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX) was in 25 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of June.

(NYSE:KMI) is also among the best stocks under $20 amid its growth potential and a massive dividend yield of 6.63%. Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) is engaged in providing an energy infrastructure in North America. The rebound in energy demand boosted its revenue by 30% year over year in the third quarter. Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead amid expectations for stronger fuel demand.\\n\\nOf the 873 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) was in 38 hedge funds’ portfolios as of June. David Abrams' Abrams Capital Management was one of the leading stakeholders in Kinder Morgan, Inc.

(NYSE:CX), and Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) has strong growth prospects ahead. Investors can also consider high growth stocks such as Apple Inc.

His hedge fund, GAMCO Investors, had a portfolio value of $11.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2021 with the top ten holdings comprising just 15% of the portfolio, a rarity in the finance world with growth-heavy portfolios. Industrial and consumer goods, as well as finance and technology, comprise a major portion of the holdings. The billionaire has a personal net worth of around $2 billion.\\n\\nGabelli founded GAMCO Investors more than four decades ago. His long-term success at the market is down to an investing strategy that places great emphasis on valuations. In the 1980s, he made hundreds of millions at the market by betting big on the telecom and media sectors. His fund has since morphed into one of the most diverse on Wall Street. Between June and September, GAMCO Investors reduced holdings in 403 stocks, made new purchases in 57, sold out of 51, and made additional purchases in 232 stocks.\\n\\nSome of the top stocks in the investment portfolio of GAMCO Investors at the end of September included Apple Inc.

Here is what the fund has to say about General Motors Company in its letter:\\n\\n“General Motors was the biggest gainer. We managed to buy it at a screamingly cheap price in the middle of March. A lot of interesting news has emerged about GM recently, including the new electric product delivery system BrightDrop and GM Cruise’s team-up with Microsoft Azure to commercialize self-driving cars in 2021. GM’s intrinsic value is crystallizing and the company is worth a whole lot more than is still reflected in the market.”\\n\\n8. Dell Technologies Inc.

Earlier this year, Dell Technologies announced that it would be spinning its $50 billion stake in VMWare, which we believe will unlock the underappreciated value of the Dell server and PC businesses. Dell’s best attribute has been strong free cash flow generation, which the company has used to de-lever and create significant latent value for equity holders. Looking ahead, we believe this core Dell business, which still trades at a discount to its hardware peer group, should instead command a premium multiple thanks to its leading market share, profitability, and impressive execution. There are few large cap companies which possess a nearly 10% FCF yield, 2.5% dividend yield and 1.5x leverage ratio; Dell is one of them.”\\n\\n7. Fiserv, Inc.

(NASDAQ:FISV) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“This quarter we researched several new stock ideas, but because of high prices, acted on only one. Thus, a new portfolio name is Fiserv, with corporate headquarters in Brookfield, WI, just down I-94 from us. Fiserv is a technology company serving financial institutions (“FIs”) and retail merchants. It has two main business lines. In the first, it’s a market leader in outsourced IT solutions for banks and credit unions, online and mobile banking technology, digital money movement solutions, and card issuing services. Fiserv’s second core business is merchant acquiring and processing, where it’s a leader in providing a variety of solutions to help all types of merchants accept digital payments. They entered this business through the acquisition of First Data in 2019.\\n\\nWithin the first business, Fiserv’s software is critical to the daily operations of FI clients. Their solutions not only provide the vital central processing systems, but also enable services such as electronic bill pay and digital money transfers at both large institutions and local banks and credit unions alike. As such, it is an incredibly sticky business that is resilient through economic cycles. On the merchant acquiring side of Fiserv, they process trillions of dollars annually for millions of merchant clients. Their solutions cater to all types of merchants and optimize for seamless acceptance and high authorization rates while also limiting fraud. Similar to the IT outsourcing business, Fiserv’s merchant solutions are critical to their customers’ daily operations. Furthermore, we are especially encouraged by their investments in new solutions, particularly Clover and Carat. Clover is a small and midsize business merchant acquiring platform and Carat is an e-commerce acquiring platform. Both these products hit the bullseye in terms of the way people are interacting with the retail industry, and both are growing at above market rates, which we believe will sustain into the future.\\n\\nIn addition to Fiserv’s favorable business characteristics and competitive positioning, the management team, led by CEO Frank Bisignano, has a track record of successfully investing for growth, improving profitability, and intelligently allocating excess capital. We believe these value-creating activities will continue going forward.\\n\\nFinancial institutions are increasingly making investments to digitize…” [read entire letter here]\\n\\n6.

NVIDIA’s GPUs are at the intersection of a number of important computing trends including the movement to the Cloud, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, edge computing, gaming, and more. We previously owned NVIDIA and sold it in the third quarter of 2020 as the price to value gap closed and our margin of safety was reduced. As with all our MVP companies, we continued to follow NVIDIA closely. Since that time, NVIDIA reported excellent results and its value has compounded rapidly.

The Women Behind Historic House Designs From Bathhouses to Fisheries, Hidden Inflation Is Creeping Across Japan Maverick 70-Year-Old CEO Is Determined to Shake Up Japanese Finance\\n\\nThere’s a reason it will dominate the small talk: The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is now worth almost half as much as the benchmark S&P 500 -- the highest ever -- and the megacap tech stocks alone represent a third of the S&P 500. Nvidia Corp. and Roblox Corp.’s sprint stood out in a year when the rest of the big tech names jogged to new highs, defying several calls to sell the sector around last year’s thanksgiving due to soaring valuations.\\n\\nHere some of the hottest stocks and themes since last Thanksgiving:\\n\\nHot Chips\\n\\nChipmaker Nvidia has soared 148% as booming chip demand and a foray into the metaverse made it the best performer on the Nasdaq 100. Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. were other winners, each rising about 80% and outperforming many of the megacap tech stocks.\\n\\nSurging EV Makers\\n\\nTesla Inc. soared to a $1 trillion market value as the electric-carmaker’s shares doubled in value, driven by a sustained pickup in sales, even as part shortages were crippling the broader auto industry. EV fever was even more evident with Rivian Automotive Inc., which doubled in value in less than two weeks after going public. Lucid Group Inc. was the sector’s other hot name.\\n\\nMetaverse Mania\\n\\nRoblox’s tripling of value from its March listing to Facebook’s name change to Meta Platforms Inc. showed the metaverse was the next big thing in tech. The rush to the space was evident with the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, an exchange traded fund focused on the theme, surpassing $500 million in assets under management on Nov. 17, having doubled in just two weeks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCryptocurrency Craze\\n\\nFrom the digital world to digital money: Bitcoin briefly reclaiming $60,000 and a rally in smaller cryptocurrencies boosted a host of related stocks such as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Blockchain Inc. and MicroStrategy Inc. Marathon Digital was among the top winners, with its stock jumping ten-fold.\\n\\nDon’t Forget FAANGs\\n\\nRetail investors who stuck with big names haven’t done badly either. The likes of Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Tesla Inc., have alone added a whopping $3.5 trillion in 2021, while the NYSE FANG+ Index is up about 39% since last Thanksgiving.\\n\\nWhile those numbers are impressive, some say valuations do seem stretched. Tech stocks haven’t been this expensive since the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and many investors remain cautious.\\n\\n“Let’s all be thankful for the tremendous returns we’ve seen in tech stocks and numerous other areas of the market this year, but not forget that a slice of humble pie may be what we’re eating next year if we’re too certain of our predictions to come,” said Matt Carvalho, chief investment officer of Cardinal Point Wealth.\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nIndia’s Paytm plummeted for a second day after its IPO, marking one of the worst debuts ever by a major technology company Prosus said analysts have valued its global portfolio of e-commerce assets at about $50 billion, excluding the stake in Tencent JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc.’s tracking by MSCI via their Hong Kong shares rather than American Depositary Receipts might reinforce a gradual shift in liquidity away from the U.S. for Chinese stocks Contemporary Amperex, a Tesla battery supplier, hit a fresh record to become China’s second-largest company listed onshore Activision Blizzard’s CEO said he’d consider leaving if he’s unable to quickly fix culture problems, Dow Jones reported Ericsson is to buy Vonage Holdings for $5.3 billion as it strives to build market presence in cloud communications services\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in America Wildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the Benefits Boeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",
       " 'For Immediate Release\\n\\nChicago, IL – November 22, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Seagate Technology Holdings plc STX and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\nWant to Become a Better Dividend Investor? Follow These 5 Tips\\n\\nIn 2021, U.S. stocks have rallied hard and they have rallied fast, with the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq each looking to notch another double-digit gain for the year.\\n\\nIt’s an incredible surge, and indicates how confident we’ve become as the economy reopens and recovers. The labor market continues to improve as well, with initial jobless claims now falling close to pre-pandemic levels and October’s jobs report showing a strong snap back in payrolls. And consumers, despite feeling the pressure of inflation and the supply chain crisis, continue to be resilient.\\n\\nWhile we can’t predict what the market will do tomorrow, we can try our best to hedge against broader economic risks by investing in quality dividend-paying stocks.\\n\\nBut how do you find them?\\n\\nSmarter Dividend Investing\\n\\nThere’s no perfect equation for stock picking. If there was, we’d all be living our best lives somewhere in a tropical paradise. But what we can do instead is rely on a few things: growth fundamentals, future (and past) performance, valuation, and a dash of gut feeling.\\n\\nWith dividend investing, goals will be a bit different compared to other strategies. Income investors are in it for the long haul, and are buying and holding stocks to receive those coveted quarterly payouts. Because who doesn’t love a little bit of extra cash, am I right?\\n\\nFirst, you should pinpoint what, exactly, you’re investing for. Is it for retirement, long-term savings, starting a new business, or general wealth building? Having a goal for your money will make you more attuned to your investments.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOnce you have that locked down, you can start filtering for top performing dividend stocks.\\n\\nTypically, you’ll find that mature, profitable companies are the ones shelling out stable dividends; these businesses—think utilities, telecoms, consumer staples, insurance companies—have hit a certain point in their growth cycle where they’re unable to grow at the rate they once did. Because of this, companies in these sectors are able to distribute their profits as dividends.\\n\\nSometimes, you’ll even be able to discover a dividend-paying stock in a flashier sector. Take\\xa0Microsoft, for example. Microsoft began paying a dividend in 2004, which at that point the tech company was in a period of stagnation where it didn’t need to reinvest its earnings to fuel high growth. Now, of course, Microsoft is one of the sector’s leading cloud and software players, and pays a dividend with a yield of 0.73%.\\n\\nAs for fundamentals, there are key metrics that income investors should pay attention to.\\n\\nThe dividend yield is something that many investors, not just income, look at, since it tells you how much income you will receive relative to the price of the stock. While a high dividend yield will provide a good source of income, it could also signal that the stock may not make a good investment; the company’s financial health and future growth is likely in question if it’s paying an ultra-high yield.\\n\\nDividend investors should also look at what’s known as the “payout ratio.”\\n\\nThis ratio, which is the percentage of profits that a company spends on dividends, is going to tell you if a company is paying out\\xa0too much of its profits on dividends. Generally, you should probably look at dividend paying stocks that pay out no more than 60% of their earnings, though if you are interested in investing in REITs, you’ll find their payout ratios to be at least 90%, as this is required.\\n\\nWhat about growth?\\n\\nLooking at a company’s annualized dividend growth rate, as well as its average annual dividend increase over a five-year period, will help show you how much a company is growing its dividend over time. Plus, future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth, so your stock picks will need to have strong year-over-year earnings growth rates, too.\\n\\nYou can also check out the list of companies known as the Dividend Aristocrats for portfolio inspiration. These companies have a strong history of profit growth, and have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\\n\\nWhen looking for dividend stocks, always remember this: companies aren’t obligated to pay dividends, and if a company cuts its dividend, that’s when you know there’s trouble on the horizon.\\n\\n2 Dividend Stocks to Consider\\n\\nWith all of this in mind, let’s take a look at some dividend stocks that could make good “buy-and-hold” additions to your portfolio.\\n\\nSeagate Technology\\n\\nSeagate is a digital memory stock that designs, manufactures, and markets a range of rigid disc drive products that are used in mainframes, workstations, and enterprise-level servers.\\n\\nSeagate recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter results. Revenue jumped 35% year-over-year to $3.12 billion, while adjusted earnings more than doubled compared to last year. Seagate’s HDD product lineup has helped keep net income, profit margins, and free cash flow on the rise for a while now, and demand should remain strong—especially now that STX launched new technology that integrates its HDDs with the PCIe interface—as more and more people work remotely.\\n\\nSTX has a solid yield of 2.65%, with a payout ratio of 40%. Seagate is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. Shares are cheap too, trading at a forward P/E of 13.3X compared to the Technology Services Market (roughly 70X). Plus, STX offers a more enticing yield than what the S&P 500 Index would provide you.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase\\n\\nJPMorgan is the biggest bank in the U.S., and was the top-performing large bank over the past decade. Additionally, JPM outperformed its peers during the pandemic recession last year, falling only 5% in 2020 while other banks experienced double-digit percentage drops.\\n\\nThere are two key things that set JPMorgan apart from other banks, the first being its “fortress balance sheet,” according to CEO Jamie Dimon. The company ended 2020 with capital reserves above $200 billion, which will provide the means to both invest in its business and return money to shareholders. The second factor is JPMorgan’s diverse revenue stream, which helps offset any tough economic periods.\\n\\nJPM, a #3 (Hold) stock, is about as stable as it gets in the financial sector. It has a forward P/E of only 13.4X, trading competitively below peers in the Finance Market (17.5X) considering its short- and long-term growth potential. Additionally, JPM has one of the best dividends in the space, with an annual yield of 2.45% and a payout ratio of 23.4%.\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\nsupport@zacks.com\\n\\nhttps://www.zacks.com\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

       " \"By Geoffrey Smith\\n\\nInvesting.com -- China's central bank hints at a possible policy easing as the real estate crisis slows the economy. Europe protests violently against the reintroduction of lockdowns and the imposition of vaccine mandates. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) CEO Bobby Kotick may be on the way out, and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), the pandemic bellwether stock par excellence, releases earnings after the close. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 22nd November.\\n\\n1. China hints at monetary easing\\n\\nChina’s central bank hinted it will ease monetary policy for the world’s second-largest economy, as it grapples with a slowdown caused by the problems of the real estate sector.\\n\\nThe People’s Bank of China left its key prime rate unchanged at 3.85% at its regular policy meeting earlier but dropped some of its more hawkish comments from the statement accompanying the decision. It had previously spoken of the need to control monetary supply tightly and not to overwhelm the economy with stimulus.\\n\\nThe yuan, which has been one of the strongest emerging-market currencies all year, edged higher to 6.3794 against the dollar, continuing to test what would be a 3 ½-year high, while benchmark stock indices rose as much as 1.4%.\\n\\n2. Activision Blizzard CEO may be on the way out\\n\\nBobby Kotick, the embattled CEO of videogames publisher Activision Blizzard, has told senior executives at the company he may quit if he isn’t able to quickly resolve the sexual harassment scandal plaguing the company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nActivision’s stock, which has been hit hard in recent months by a series of allegations suggesting a toxic and discriminatory workplace culture, rose over 2% in premarket trading in response.\\n\\nThe report follows allegations last week that Kotick had been aware of problems at the company for much longer than he has so far admitted. The allegations prompted widespread staff discontent and concern among major gaming partners such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SONY).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n3. Stocks set to open higher after Clarida blow; KKR, Zoom Video eyed\\n\\nU.S. stocks are set to start the week clearly higher, after closing last week on a mixed note, torn between a generally positive economic outlook and the fear of an accelerated tightening of monetary policy. Federal Reserve vice-chairman Richard Clarida had acknowledged that Fed policymakers may discuss a faster phase-out of its bond purchases than currently planned when they meet again next month.\\n\\nBy 6:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 167 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both up 0.4%.\\n\\nThe day is devoid of major economic indicators. Zoom Video heads a thin earnings slate, but only after the close. Other stocks in focus include Vonage, which Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) wants to buy for $6.2 billion, and KKR (NYSE:KKR), which has lit a fire under European telecom stocks with a bid for Telecom Italia (MI:TLIT).\\n\\n4. Europe riots against Covid-19 measures as Bundesbank sounds inflation alarm\\n\\nGermany’s inflation rate will hit 6% this month while the economy will slow, the Deutsche Bundesbank warned in a monthly report that puts the recent surge in Covid-19 cases across Europe into an even more gloomy context.\\n\\nThere were riots against the reintroduction of mobility restrictions in the Netherlands and Belgium at the weekend, and smaller-scale protests in Italy, Croatia and Austria, the last of which imposed a full nationwide lockdown at the end of last week.\\n\\nKarl Lauterbach, a leading health expert with Germany's center-left SPD that will most likely head the next coalition government, said at the weekend that the country could no longer afford to rule out mandating vaccination for everyone. The euro continued to struggle below $1.1300, meanwhile.\\n\\n5. Oil struggles after Japan warms to reserve release plans\\n\\nThe news out of Europe also weakened crude oil, which has fostered expectations of widespread mobility curbs over the next couple of months. Institutes such as the IEA and OPEC have already warned that the market could tip from shortage to surplus as a result of this and other trends.\\n\\nBy 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 0.3% at $76.14 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 0.2% at $79.05 a barrel, close to their intraday lows.\\n\\nOn Friday, CFTC data had showed that speculative long positions had fallen again in the week through Tuesday, suggesting that financial players have lost faith in oil’s momentum amid rising talk of a coordinated release of strategic reserves by major consumers. Japan’s new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida indicated earlier Japan would be open to such a move.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nChina Easing Hints, Kotick Exit, Europe Covid Riots - What's Moving Markets\\n\\nThailand plans to join talks on trans-Pacific trade pact membership\\n\\nAfrican nations mend and make do as China tightens Belt and Road\",\n",
       " \"(Bloomberg) -- Activision Blizzard Inc.

The Women Behind Historic House Designs An Oil Company Went Up in Flames, Burning Lenders and the Planet Hong Kong's New Museum Tries to Please Art World — and Beijing\\n\\nKotick didn’t rule out the possibility for his departure if misconduct issues in the company aren’t resolved “with speed,” said the people, who weren’t identified by Dow Jones.\\n\\nThe comment came after a Wall Street Journal article last week alleged the CEO was aware of allegations of sexual harassment and assault against female employees, including rape, but failed to report them to the board of directors, prompting criticism from staff, investors and business partners.\\n\\nKotick remaining CEO “will only elongate uncertainty” and “impede the rebuilding and restoring of morale and productivity,” Truist Securities analyst Matthew Thornton wrote in a report last week, adding that the company will likely change its CEO, which would be a positive.\\n\\nActivision didn’t immediately respond to an emailed query seeking a comment on the Dow Jones report Sunday. In a statement following the earlier Journal article, the company said the board was confident Kotick “appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention.”\\n\\nThe company, known for hit video games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, has been in turmoil since the summer, when it was sued by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of sexual harassment, unequal pay and retaliation.\\n\\nThe agency described a “frat boy culture” at the company and accused leadership of failing to take action. Kotick’s plight worsened when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later launched its own investigation into how the company handled the reports of misconduct.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRead: Activision CEO Kotick Faulted Over Handling of Staff Misconduct\\n\\nA group of institutional investors also sued Activision in Delaware over claims that video game giant’s “1980s fraternity house” culture has made it a persistently toxic place for women to work.\\n\\nActivision employees called for Kotick to resign and staged a walkout on the company’s Santa Monica campus on Tuesday after the Journal article.\\n\\nThe video game giant is also facing pressure from business partners. Microsoft Corp.’s head of Xbox Phil Spencer said he’s “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments,” in light of the recent revelations at the video game publisher.\\n\\nIn an email to staff seen by Bloomberg News, Spencer said he and the gaming leadership team are “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision, referring to the Journal report.\\n\\nActivision shares have lost a third of their value this year, compared with the 25% gain in the S&P 500 index.\\n\\nJPMorgan analyst Alexia Quadrani cut the recommendation on the stock to neutral from overweight last week, citing the growing controversy over Kotick. The “recent negative headlines introduce a significant amount of uncertainty into this story,” Quadrani said, adding that “we don’t expect shares can outperform until there is clarity on this issue.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in America Boeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed First Task for the Teamsters’ Next Boss: Take On UPS\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",
       " '(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. has unveiled plans to invest $17 billion in a new advanced chip plant in Texas, a marquee project that will fortify the U.S. semiconductor industry.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAsia’s Richest Man Looks to Walton Family Playbook on Succession The 24-Year-Old Aiming to Dethrone Victoria’s Secret New York City Is Building a Wall of Oysters to Fend Off Floods The Women Behind Historic House Designs From Bathhouses to Fisheries, Hidden Inflation Is Creeping Across Japan\\n\\n“Increasing domestic production of semiconductor chips is critical for our national and economic security,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement Tuesday.\\n\\nThe project will result in the creation of more than 2,000 jobs, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said at a press conference announcing the plans. “The implications of this facility extend far beyond the boundaries of Texas,” Abbott said. “It’s going to impact the entire world.”\\n\\nKorea’s largest company will build the facility in Taylor, Texas, about 30 miles from Austin, where Samsung has invested billions in a sprawling complex that already houses more than 3,000 employees and fabricates some of the country’s most sophisticated chips. Construction is slated to start in the first half of 2022, and the plant will begin production in the second half of 2024.\\n\\nSamsung joins Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in making substantial investments in the U.S. The new facilities further the Biden administration’s goal of safeguarding the production of cutting-edge chips vital to defense as well as technologies like autonomous cars. It’s part of Washington’s broader effort to counter China’s rising economic power, as well as lure home some of the advanced manufacturing that in past decades has gravitated toward Asia.\\n\\n“Samsung’s new plant will help narrow the gap with TSMC’s production capability by making chips at the clients’ home,” said Kim Sunwoo, an analyst at Meritz Securities. “As the U.S. prioritizes domestic chip manufacturing, the company will be able to receive various benefits with its production base in the country.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe global chip crunch exposed imbalances in the industry and prompted governments from Brussels to Tokyo to court TSMC and Samsung -- the two companies that make most of the world’s most advanced chips for clients like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp.\\n\\nNeither the Texas project nor TSMC’s $12 billion Arizona expansion are likely to alleviate the shortages immediately. But their construction could lay the groundwork for a future American-centered chip ecosystem by attracting and training the component suppliers that typically spring up around such operations.\\n\\nIn June, President Joe Biden laid out a sweeping effort to secure critical supply chains, including a proposed $52 billion to bolster domestic chipmaking. His administration has repeatedly voiced the need to increase semiconductor production in the U.S., saying that was the best way to compete with China and mitigate disruptions like those stemming from Covid-19.\\n\\nSamsung spent months reviewing different sites and incentive packages before landing on Taylor. Samsung’s de facto leader Jay Y. Lee, who walked free just months ago after serving time for corruption, green-lit the project after a recent trip in the U.S. where he met with prospective clients and partners from Alphabet Inc.’s Sundar Pichai to Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The local government pulled out the stops, including waiving 90% of property taxes for a decade, and 85% for the following 10 years. The project could potentially receive additional tax breaks because it’s in a federal opportunity zone, a program designed to spur investment in poor areas.\\n\\n“Samsung is targeting American customers aggressively,” said Jeff Pu, an analyst with Haitong International Securities Group.\\n\\nRead more: White House Spurns Intel Plan to Boost Chip Production in China\\n\\nThe World Is Short of Computer Chips.

       " 'Mohamed El-Erian says the Fed\\'s inflation screwup will \\'go down in history\\' — but he\\'s using these 3 stocks to take advantage\\n\\nIf a prominent economist is right, the Federal Reserve’s reaction to skyrocketing inflation is “going to go down in history as one of the worst inflation calls.”\\n\\nThe Fed has said for months that inflation is a “transitory” trend triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at asset management firm Allianz SE, doesn’t agree.\\n\\n\"They got stuck on the narrative and held on to it for too long,\" El-Erian says in an interview with Bloomberg. \"The result of which is they\\'re looking at inflation that is much higher than they ever expected ... much broader than they expected ... and that\\'s going to last even longer than they expected.\"\\n\\nFortunately, El-Erian has helped load his firm’s portfolio with several inflation-ready stock picks. If you’re looking for a safe way to invest your extra cash, here are three stocks that could keep or grow their value if inflation is here to stay.\\n\\nMicrosoft DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\\n\\nIt may not get the publicity it once did, but Microsoft’s tech is everywhere. And the company’s cloud computing expertise should allow it to earn a fair chunk of a market that tech research firm Gartner says could grow to more than $360 billion in 2022.\\n\\nCloud computing is both the present and future of business. In companies of a certain size, it’s a must; they simply don’t have the option of cutting back on reliable cloud services — and Microsoft’s Azure definitely qualifies — just because inflation is driving prices higher.\\n\\nIn fact, it was growth in Azure revenue that helped Microsoft smash its revenue target by almost $3 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This year, the company’s stock is up 56%.\\n\\nYou might be able to put off the purchase of a new Windows laptop because of higher prices, but thousands of companies running Azure don’t have the same flexibility.\\n\\nOn that note, if today’s high prices are tempting you to stop buying stocks, remember you can always build a portfolio using nothing more than your “spare change.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPayPal Lets Design Studio / Shutterstock\\n\\nJust because prices are going up, it doesn’t mean people have cut back on using PayPal. The online payment leader processed over $1 trillion worth of transactions in the last year, taking a tasty little nibble out of each one.\\n\\nInflation is actually great news for PayPal. It can collect higher fees from each payment without having to raise prices on its own.\\n\\nPayPal has set itself up for long-term success, too. In addition to the 32 million merchants who use its primary services, the company has expanded into credit cards, QR code payments and point-of-sale software, making it a player both on- and offline.\\n\\nPayPal stock is hovering around $190 a share. That’s down about 18% since the beginning of the year — but if it’s still too pricey, you can always use an app that allows you to buy fractions of shares. That way you can invest with as much money as you’re willing to spend.\\n\\nJPMorgan Bumble Dee / Shutterstock\\n\\nBanks tend to do well when inflation rears its ugly head. The Fed increases interest rates, and banks begin generating revenue by offering more expensive loans and mortgages.\\n\\nAnd if you’re going to roll the dice on a bank, going with America’s largest isn’t a bad strategy.\\n\\nJPMorgan just wrapped up a solid third quarter, with a 19% increase in deposits year-over-year, net interest income beating expectations by around $200 million and investment banking revenue up 50% versus the same period last year.\\n\\nAnd that was all during a period when interest rates were at record lows. A little tightening by the Fed, and things could be looking even sweeter.\\n\\nJPMorgan stock has been on a tear this year — it’s up 30% since the calendar flipped over — so if you’re planning to nab some shares, waiting may not be in your best interest.\\n\\nAnother inflation hedge with growth potential Scharfsinn / Shutterstock\\n\\nIf rising inflation makes you hesitant about the stock market altogether, it may be time to take a look at a real asset that can generate some real returns.\\n\\nAn investment in productive U.S. farmland could put you on the right side of both rising commodity and land prices. And with the global population continuing to grow, it’s not like the demand for food will decrease any time soon.\\n\\nFarmland used to be off-limits to the average investor, but not anymore.

Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\\n\\nYear-To-Date Gain: 300%\\n\\nSignet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) is a specialty store that retails diamonds, watches, and other luxury products. The company recently announced that it would be acquiring Diamond Direct, a jewelry retail business, for $490 million. The deal in this regard will close by the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022.\\n\\nWells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow recently maintained an Overweight rating on Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) stock and raised the price target to $120 from $100, noting that the purchase of Diamond Direct would add to the existing revenue of the company.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Select Equity Group is a leading shareholder in Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) with 5.2 million shares worth more than $412 million.\\n\\nJust like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) is one of the stocks on the radar of elite investors.\\n\\nIn its Q3 2020 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“We also saw Signet Jewelers (SIG) start to deliver improved performance during the quarter and believe their initiatives on closing unprofitable stores, expanding new Omni-channel capabilities, and launching new product offerings should begin to drive an improvement in their operations over the coming quarters. Historically, Signet’s stock price has performed very well coming out of an economic downturn. With the company valuation multiples near 2009 lows, it wouldn’t take much to see Signet’s share price double during the ongoing economic recovery. While we are highlighting the consumer space, we also wanted to mention a new investment, Chicos FAS, Inc. (CHS). The investment opportunity reminds us a lot of Bed Bath and GameStop earlier this year: a new CEO who is executing well on a new transformation plan, closing unprofitable stores, significantly streamlining and realigning their operations, and enhancing new product for their Chicos, White House Black Market, and Soma brands. Chicos has an asset-rich balance sheet, nearly $1.4B in total assets. The company’s real estate assets (land and buildings) combined with the cash on the balance sheet are significantly higher than the company’s current equity market capitalization! Over the next couple of years, the company has the potential to return to a $2B+ revenue base, which would support $100M in free cash flow. We believe a successful turnaround over the next couple of years has the potential to drive the share price 5-10x higher than current levels.”\\n\\n9. Tecnoglass Inc.

(NASDAQ:UPST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“During the quarter, we purchased Upstart Holdings Inc. Upstart is an artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based lending platform. The company uses AI models to underwrite superior loans with lower interest rates, lower default rates, higher approval rates, and increased underwriting automation. Consumers can access Upstart-powered loans through its banking partners’ websites; however, most of its loans are underwritten on Upstart.com. Upstart has a fee-based revenue model and retains only a small portion of the loans, while the majority of the loans end up on the balance sheets of its partner banks or are sold into the capital markets. We believe Upstart’s technology is superior to the FICO score, which is ubiquitous within the consumer credit markets.

       " \"Last year was a great one for video game stocks. With most of the world under lockdown, gamers had more time to themselves than usual. And they spent a lot of that time playing video games, driving up the returns for related stocks.\\n\\nCompanies active in the space also did not rest on their haunches. With every passing day, new games are becoming more immersive, realistic and advanced. Online gaming communities have now become major social hubs for people to play together in an environment that feels like home, whether you’re looking at amateur tournaments or playing alongside your favorite pro player on a streaming service.\\n\\nAnd this isn’t limited to desktop computers at home, either. There’s also been a huge boom within e-sports competitions that offer gamers major prizes.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe pandemic intensified this trend; Newzoo projects the market size will be $1.8 billion by 2022. As growth continues into next year and beyond, it will create a significant investment opportunity in video game stocks.\\n\\n7 Cheap Stocks Under $10 That Are Actually Worth Your Time\\n\\nConsidering the holidays are coming up, sales will continue to be strong. Consequently, now is the best time to recheck your portfolio and initiate or add to your position in these video game stocks:\\n\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO)\\n\\nVideo Game Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA) An Nvidia (NVDA) semiconductor chip on a black background.\\n\\nSource: Hairem / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a competitive edge in gaming, then it’s probably worth considering Nvidia. The company produces the high-end graphics cards needed to run video games at a high-performance quality. Many professional e-sports players prefer its chips since the company settles for nothing less than excellence.\\n\\nNvidia has provided cutting-edge technology that makes gaming more immersive than ever with its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). This is why the company’s products have become one of the top choices among pro players who competitively play titles like League of Legends or Dota 2 on world stages.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn terms of fundamentals, Nvidia has always been a top performer. According to CNBC data, the chipmaker missed analyst expectations just once in the last 12 quarters.\\n\\nIt reported outstanding third-quarter earnings for the fiscal year 2022 after market close on Nov. 17, surpassing analyst expectations by a handy margin. Nvidia delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) year-over-year (YOY) growth of 60%.\\n\\nRevenues jumped 50% YOY to a new quarterly record of $7.1 billion. The unexpected jump came from strong sales of graphics processing units that are used for video games and other types of digital media production, like animation or 3D modeling workflows.\\n\\nData center sales for Nvidia accelerated 55% in the last quarter and hit a quarterly record of $2.9 billion. Nvidia’s CFO, Colette Kress, attributed the growth to hyperscale customers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\\n\\nElectronic Arts (EA) The Electronic Arts (EA stock) logo on a phone in front of a screen displaying EA game from its FIFA franchise\\n\\nSource: Sergel Elagin / Shutterstock\\n\\nElectronic Arts hold licenses to several notable franchises, including Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL, NBALive and Battlefield. Due to a large number of these franchises, EA has managed several years of double-digit revenue growth.\\n\\nThat will continue for the foreseeable future because game publishers have been betting big on virtual reality and next-generation consoles. The tailwinds from these technologies are likely to bring more success for all game developers, including EA. VR games should continue gaining mainstream traction, thanks in part to its ability to provide an immersive experience.\\n\\nElectronic Arts reported its fiscal Q2 2022 results on Nov. 3. The California-based video game giant reported a GAAP net income of $294 million. This marks the second quarter in a row when the company has broken records with an earnings report that shines a light on successful new releases.\\n\\nRevenues are also up considerably. Its Q2 sales figure of $1.8 billion compares very favorably with $1.2 billion a year ago. If you feel there is a slowdown, please remember we were in the middle of a pandemic last year. Hence, take year-over-year comparisons with a pinch of salt.\\n\\nAndrew Wilson, the CEO of Electronic Arts, said, “This was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts.” He added that the video game company will “deliver more amazing experiences this holiday season, and connect hundreds of millions of players around the world through our EA Sports games, Apex Legends, Battlefield 2042 and more.”\\n\\n7 Stocks to Watch Now as Consumer Prices Spike\\n\\nHence, EA stock looks like a great one if you are looking to make excellent year-end returns.\\n\\nVideo Game Stocks: Activision Blizzard (ATVI) Quarantine May Not Move Activision Blizzard Stock the Way You'd Expect\\n\\nSource: Lauren Elisabeth / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nActivision Blizzard owns popular titles like Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft, which has helped it become one of America’s best-known brands in gaming today. However, the company has struggled in the last few months because of game delays and sexual harassment allegations.\\n\\nTwo hotly anticipated games from the Blizzard segment — Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV — are facing production delays. This can be partially attributed to key management personnel like Jen Oneal, co-leader of the Blizzard division, stepping down from their roles.\\n\\nMeanwhile, calls are growing for longtime CEO of Activision, Bobby Kotick, to resign from his position. A Wall Street Journal report said the executive had knowledge about sexual misconduct allegations at the company, but failed to bring these claims to the board of directors.\\n\\nAs a result, the company’s employees have launched a petition urging the CEO to step down. How this will play out is anyone’s guess. However, it has done a number on the stock price despite stellar third-quarter numbers.\\n\\nIn a move to make Activision Blizzard more inclusive, Kotick outlined five steps the company would take to increase diversity and improve conditions. The plan includes implementing zero-tolerance harassment policies and a commitment to increase the participation of women and non-binary people in Activision’s workforce by 50%.\\n\\nRevenues for the company were up 5.9% in Q3 over last year. Net bookings also grew by 6%, coming out at $1.88 billion. Looking ahead, the video game giant forecasts fourth-quarter adjusted sales to be $2.78 billion; consensus estimates are forecasting $2.85 billion. The sole major release this quarter was Diablo 2: Resurrected, but it was a winner for the company.\\n\\nActivision Blizzard’s game catalogue and balance sheet are strong, but it has considerable work to do to make its promised improvements. If investors believe the company can turn things around, they may find value in ATVI stock at its current level.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\\n\\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest tech companies in the world. It’s behind popular products like Microsoft Office, Surface tablet/laptop hybrids and even Bing search engine.\\n\\nBut some might not realize Microsoft has a powerful gaming business as well, which it channels through the Xbox One console. Most of the headlines are reserved for the bigger business segments. However, ignore the games division at your peril since it generates a lot of money for the conglomerate.\\n\\nLast month, Microsoft posted an excellent first quarter for fiscal 2022, beating analyst expectations. Overall gaming revenue is up 16% for the quarter. Hardware revenue gained 166%, and the demand for Xbox Series X and Series S consoles is not slowing down anytime soon.\\n\\nFor this impressive growth, the credit has to go to the management for handling supply chain constraints. In the last few quarters, the semiconductor shortage has come back to haunt several industries. The tech sector is no exception.\\n\\nIt’s unclear whether the company will match demand with console supply into Q2, and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has warned that supply constraints may last until 2022.\\n\\n6 Mega-Cap Stocks That Make Great Stocking Stuffers\\n\\nOn the bright side, though, Microsoft will benefit from the Halo franchise boosting top-line growth with the holidays coming up. It is one of the most consistent performers of the company. Do not expect anything different this season.\\n\\nVideo Game Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Earnings reports: Google (GOOG, GOOGL) headquarters in Mountain View, California.\\n\\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nGoogle subsidiary YouTube has been one of its best-performing areas for revenue growth in recent years with its gaming content. The service has been a major player in gaming videos, with more than 100 billion watch time hours.\\n\\nAn increasing number of Twitch streamers now use YouTube as their go-to platform. Amazon backs Twitch, so it has a lot of cash to invest in improving operations and bringing back users who have left.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Google parent company Alphabet posted a strong second-quarter recently. Revenue jumped 41% and earnings per share increased 68%, beating analyst estimates handsomely. Net income of $18.9 billion represents a jump of 68% over the year-ago period.\\n\\nAlthough one of the most diversified companies on the planet, it has to give some credit to YouTube raking in the big bucks. The world’s largest video platform managed to produce $7 billion in ad sales, representing a YOY increase of 43%.\\n\\nThis exemplary quarter for YouTube brought it very close to fellow streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), whose third-quarter revenue came in at $7.5 billion.\\n\\nHowever, one blemish on its gaming business is Stadia, a Google-backed video game streaming service launched in 2019. Uptake is slow despite more than two years of operation. Moving forward, the company needs to keep investing in this area. If it manages to turn the corner, Alphabet will become one of the top video game stocks in the world.\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (amzn) LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAmazon’s Twitch is a popular video game streaming service that allows viewers to watch live content and chat with other players or streamers. YouTube can’t keep up with Amazon’s success in this sector of popular media consumption.\\n\\nData collected by Streamlabs and Storm Hatchet estimated that Twitch accounted for 72% of Q1 streaming hours. YouTube was second at 15%. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) came third with 12%.\\n\\nAmazon’s Twitch has managed to dominate video game streaming. It may only be one percent of Amazon’s total revenue, but it will eventually become a significant contributor.\\n\\nThe bigger battle, however, is between Twitch and YouTube moving forward. Microsoft’s now-defunct platform Mixer never posed much of a challenge. You cannot say the same for YouTube, which is gargantuan in comparison.\\n\\nIt doesn’t help that streamers have low confidence in Twitch at the moment. It is all because of the prevalence of “hate raids” on the platform. For those who are unfamiliar, hate raids are when harassers use bots and dummy accounts to attack someone from marginalized communities. The Twitch-wide epidemic led to a walkout called #ADayOffTwitch, where streamers did not use the platform for a day in protest.\\n\\n7 Metaverse Stocks With the Potential to Make You Millions\\n\\nThe company can do without this negative publicity. Nevertheless, Twitch is one of the most profitable streaming services with over $500 million projected annual revenues.\\n\\nVideo Game Stocks: Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) an image of the box for Take Two's (TTWO) Red Dead Redemption 2 for the PlayStation 4\\n\\nSource: Thomas Pajot / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTake-Two Interactive Software owns two important publishing labels, Rockstar Games and 2K, with in-house development teams.

Meanwhile, net bookings jumped to $984.9 million from $957.5 million. The game publisher’s revenue set up its seventh consecutive earnings beat, per CNBC data.\\n\\nThe company attributed the sales growth to NBA 2K22 and NBA 2K21. Major releases including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Borderlands 3 were also well-received by users and contributed positively to sales.\\n\\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is one of the most successful games in history, with more than 155 million copies sold since its release.

Despite the rise in yields, dip-buying in big tech is expected to continue.\\n\\n“[W]hen somewhat frothy expectations build valuations up to the point where names that are among the leadership in tech are increasingly vulnerable to a pullback in their share price, [investors] should use those opportunities to add to positions if they're underweight or have established positions,” Luschini added.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nConsumer discretionary also weighed on the broader market, paced by a 12% slump in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) after the electronics retailer’s weaker-than-expected holiday comparable sales offset third-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.\\n\\nCyclical concerns of the market including financials, energy and industrials racked gains amid a rotation from value to growth.\\n\\nEnergy jumped more than 3% as oil prices rallied despite President Joe Biden saying Tuesday the U.S. will release 50 million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in tandem with other major oil consuming countries to curb rising energy prices.\\n\\n“It will take time, but before long, you should see the price of gas fall where you fill up your tank,” Biden said on Tuesday.\\n\\nOn Monday, OPEC said it would reassess its plan to slow production cuts if major oil consuming countries move ahead with plans to tap emergency oil reserves.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nRepublican FTC commissioners ask White House for evidence on gasoline price probe request\\n\\nDell forecasts upbeat revenue on strong PC demand\",\n",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 4 Stock Picks of ESG Investor Jeffrey Ubben.\\n\\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns have become a key focus of investors as they seek to identify winners at the stock market. Impact investing — traditionally defined as investments that aim to generate an environmental, social, or governance impact in addition to a financial gain — are now all the rave on Wall Street. This is perhaps why Jeffrey Ubben, the co-founder of ValueAct Capital, one of the most successful hedge funds in the world, recently left his position as chief of ValueAct to pursue a career in impact investing with Inclusive Capital.\\n\\nLatest 13F filings show that Inclusive Capital had a portfolio value of over $915 million at the end of September 2021, down from $1 billion at the end of the second quarter. Between June and September, the fund made additional purchases in 3 stocks and sold out of 1 stock. Presently, the portfolio comprises just nine companies. The fund is working with several companies to improve ESG practices in the corporate workplace. Ubben has a personal net worth of $80 million.\\n\\nIn 2020, when announcing that he would be leaving ValueAct to focus solely on ESG investing, Ubben told investors in a letter that he aimed to “partner with management and the boards of companies whose core businesses seek to achieve the reversal of corporate harm”. ValueAct had a portfolio value of $16 billion when Ubben decided to leave, a glowing testament to the success of the impact investor who had only founded the firm back in 2000. Investors keen for an entry into ESG investing should check out some top ESG stocks.\\n\\nSome of the top ESG stocks to buy right now include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and PayPal Holdings, Inc.

NKLA’s history is full of deception and vaporware. They showed a video of the Nikola One in motion; they later admitted that it didn’t work and was just rolling down a hill. NKA’s founder Trevor Milton resigned in disgrace aer Hindenburg Research published a report calling NKLA an “intricate fraud.” NKLA is currently under investigation by both the SEC and DoJ.

Nevertheless, the company sports an $8b market cap, because “electric vehicles.” Though pretenders are particularly ubiquitous in the bubbly EV industry, pretenders are to be found in many other industries as well.”\\n\\n6.

While ExxonMobil does plan to increase capital expenditure, we’ve been disappointed in its regrettable failure to address ongoing emission trends, which reflects poorly on management’s foresight. As a result, we sold our ExxonMobil holdings.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 4 Stock Picks of ESG Investor Jeffrey Ubben.\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\nBeyond GameStop: Reddit’s WallStreetBets is Now Targeting These 10 Stocks 10 Hedge Funds that Profited from Reddit’s Meme Stock Craze 10 Best SPACs to Invest In According to Reddit\\n\\nDisclosure.

This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Factor Mix A-Series Index before fees and expenses.\\n\\nThe MSCI USA Factor Mix A-Series Index measures the equity market performance of large and mid-cap companies across the U.S. equity market. It aims to represent the performance of a combination of three factors: value, quality, and low volatility.\\n\\nCost & Other Expenses\\n\\nCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.15% for QUS, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\\n\\nQUS's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.39%.\\n\\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\\n\\nIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\n\\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 31.10% of the portfolio.

       " \"CEO Satya Nadella has done a decent job of delivering relatively good performance at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 30 November 2021, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders may still be hesitant of being overly generous with CEO compensation.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Microsoft\\n\\nComparing Microsoft Corporation's CEO Compensation With the industry\\n\\nAt the time of writing, our data shows that Microsoft Corporation has a market capitalization of US$2.6t, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$50m for the year to June 2021. That's a notable increase of 12% on last year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$2.5m.\\n\\nOn comparing similar companies in the industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$11m. This suggests that Satya Nadella is paid more than the median for the industry. What's more, Satya Nadella holds US$535m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.\\n\\nComponent 2021 2020 Proportion (2021) Salary US$2.5m US$2.5m 5% Other US$47m US$42m 95% Total Compensation US$50m US$44m 100%\\n\\nTalking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 12% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 88% of the pie. Microsoft pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. ceo-compensation\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation's Growth\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation's earnings per share (EPS) grew 55% per year over the last three years. Its revenue is up 20% over the last year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOverall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's a real positive to see this sort of revenue growth in a single year. That suggests a healthy and growing business. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.\\n\\nHas Microsoft Corporation Been A Good Investment?\\n\\nWe think that the total shareholder return of 230%, over three years, would leave most Microsoft Corporation shareholders smiling. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.\\n\\nIn Summary...\\n\\nThe company's decent performance might have made most shareholders happy, possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the concerns to be discussed in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.\\n\\nWhile CEO pay is an important factor to be aware of, there are other areas that investors should be mindful of as well. That's why we did some digging and identified 1 warning sign for Microsoft that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.\\n\\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a different set of stocks.

       " 'By Geoffrey Smith\\n\\nInvesting.com -- President Joe Biden is set to announce a coordinated release of strategic petroleum reserves with other big importers, aimed at taking the froth off fuel prices. Zoom Video stock tumbles as its earnings fail to answer questions about its long-term future. Stocks are still under pressure after being dragged down by bonds on Monday in response to Jerome Powell\\'s reappointment at the Federal Reserve. The ECB sounds a more hawkish tone as new data show the economy holding up well, and it\\'s a bad week for Turkey, as well as turkeys. Here\\'s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 23rd November.\\n\\n1. Biden to announce oil measures\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden is set to announce the release of oil from the U.S.’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, aiming to stop the economic recovery being derailed by gasoline prices that have hit seven-year highs in recent weeks, according to various newswire reports.\\n\\nIndia, South Korea and Japan are also expected to make similar announcements this week, in a concerted effort by oil importers worldwide to relieve the pressure on their economies.\\n\\nChina is unlikely to publicly join the initiative, S&P Global Platts service reported, due to concerns about keeping good relations with Russia and Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nReuters and others cited unnamed OPEC sources playing down reports (which had supported prices on Monday) that the bloc could respond to the U.S.-led move by halting its phased increases in production.\\n\\nBy 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), U.S. crude futures were down 1.1% at $75.90 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.7% at $79.16 a barrel.\\n\\n2. The Pandemic Trade is over (Zoom redux)\\n\\nZoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock shed 8% in premarket trading after publishing results and guidance that were, if anything, a little above market estimates. The pandemic winner par excellence, Zoom stock is now trading back at its lowest since June 2020.\\n\\nAnalysts flagged a disappointing growth outlook both with large customers and with new services. The market move thus arguably reflects disappointment at its ability to grow beyond the basic video-conferencing apps that made its name a verb last year. That leaves it exposed to competition from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), whose Meet and Teams apps come with a fuller suite of related services.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMore broadly, the news means that Zoom has joined a growing list of stocks that have either mostly or wholly unwound their pandemic-era gains.\\n\\n3. Stocks set for steady opening after bond-driven sell-off; retail earnings in focus again\\n\\nU.S. stocks are set to edge lower at the opening later, having been dragged down by the abrupt move in bonds that followed Jerome Powell’s reappointment as Federal Reserve Chair on Monday. The benchmark 2-year Treasury bond yield continues to trade around 0.63%, its highest since April 2020.\\n\\nBy 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow Jones futures were essentially flat, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures, with their higher concentration of longer-duration, interest rate-sensitive tech stocks, were down 0.4%.\\n\\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) head the list of companies reporting early, along with Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). The retail theme continues after the close with updates from Gap and JW Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN). Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) are also due to report.\\n\\n4. Europe appears to withstand rise in Covid-19 cases\\n\\nEurope’s economy withstood the recent rise in Covid-19 cases better than expected, according to the latest round of purchasing manager indices released by IHS Markit.\\n\\nThe flash composite Eurozone PMI rose for the first time in four months in November, with activity ticking up in both manufacturing and services. In the UK, services weakened slightly, bringing down the composite PMI to a still-healthy 57.7.\\n\\nThe price components of both indices continued to show inflation running at a high level. In an interview earlier, Isabel Schnabel became the first European Central Bank board member to admit that inflation risks are now skewed to the upside, while Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said that the fresh wave of lockdowns in Europe shouldn’t stop the ECB winding down its bond purchases.\\n\\n5. Bad week for turkeys, bad week for Turkey\\n\\nTurkey lurched towards a full-blown currency crisis, the lira falling as much as 8.8% in response to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s latest attempts to defy economic orthodoxy.\\n\\nErdogan had doubled down after a cabinet meeting late on Monday on his insistence that the central bank cut interest rates despite inflation running at over 20%.\\n\\n“\"I reject policies that will contract our country, weaken it, condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty,\" Reuters quoted Erdogan as saying.\\n\\nThe dollar has now risen 66% against the lira so far this year, making the lira by far the worst performing G20 currency in the world.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nBiden\\'s SPR Release, Zoom Earnings, Turkey Trouble - What\\'s Moving Markets\\n\\nFloods top of mind as Canadian PM Trudeau outlines priorities to parliament\\n\\nTroubled by supply chain woes, German firms diversify and relocate - DIHK',\n",
       " \"By Dhirendra Tripathi\\n\\nInvesting.com – Zoom stock (NASDAQ:ZM) traded 8% lower in Tuesday’s premarket as the company’s addition of large clients fell short of expectations for the second straight quarter.\\n\\nThe company closed October at 512,100 customers with more than 10 employees, an increase of just 18%. Growth in such users was 36% in the second quarter, and the numbers were taken as fresh evidence of the company's inability to sustain the explosive growth it showed in the first phase of the pandemic.\\n\\nExpectations from the video-conferencing platform, which became a household name as the pandemic triggered a boom in remote work and study.\\n\\nExperts have been focusing on its popularity with larger customers and its expansion beyond video-conferencing tools to assess its ability to compete in the long run with companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which offer fuller suites of services.\\n\\nThe company has launched new offerings such as its Events platform for large business meetings, Cloud-calling service Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms for in-office meetings, all directed at widening its user base.\\n\\nSales in the third quarter rose 35% to $1.05 billion while adjusted profit per share was $1.11, both a little ahead of expectations.\\n\\nAdjusted EPS in the current quarter is seen at about $1.06 on revenue of around $1.05 billion.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nZoom Slumps as Growth in Large Clients User Base Falls Short\\n\\nKellogg strike enters eighth week as talks break down again\\n\\nImpossible Foods raises $500 million in latest funding round led by Mirae\",\n",

The trust is overseen by Michael Larson, a money manager who is the chief investment officer at the trust since 1994 and also manages the private fortune of the Gates family. According to the latest 13F filings, the trust had a portfolio value of $23 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2021.\\n\\nAlmost half of the portfolio of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust comprises just Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Securities filings show that the trust made new purchases in seven stocks and reduced holdings in seven as well during the third quarter. Presently, the portfolio comprises just 22 equities.\\n\\nMichael Larson, who manages the trust, is not a very well-known name in the finance world despite the fact that he has managed to grow the personal fortune of Gates from around $10 billion almost three decades ago to more than $139 billion now. Larson also oversees Cascade Investment, a family office for the Gates that holds a majority of their assets. Investors who want to follow in the footsteps of Gates and Larson to grow their wealth should check out the latest portfolio of the trust.\\n\\nSome of the top stocks in the portfolio of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust at the end of September included Alphabet Inc.

The markets it competes for are enormous, which gives the company the ability to compound at scale. In the past quarter alone, the company generated over $40 billion in revenue, representing a 17% growth rate. The inherent operating leverage in Microsoft’s business model continues and led to 34% earnings growth this past quarter.

The CEO of one of the country’s largest video game companies, Kotick has reportedly told executives at Activision Blizzard that he’ll resign if he can’t resolve the company’s myriad harassment scandals in short order.\\n\\nBut the problems at Activision Blizzard will require systemic changes, including Kotick’s removal right now — especially after The Wall Street Journal’s revelations last week that he knew about the company’s issues for years. Those problems include allegations of rape, sexual harassment, and sexual and racial discrimination.\\n\\nIf the company wants to move past these controversies, it needs to make a dramatic move. If not, Activision Blizzard risks losing the very people who make its games so successful: its software developers, testers, and engineers.\\n\\n“People are leaving. I'm getting goodbye emails, like almost at least three a week,” explained Jessica Gonzalez, senior test analyst at Activision Blizzard’s Battle.net. Bobby Kotick returns to the afternoon session of the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S. July 7, 2021. REUTERS/Brian Losness\\n\\n“I'm seeing people leaving the company, and high-level women, women that are in senior positions are just leaving the company because they have no faith in Kotick,” added Gonzalez, who helped organize an employee walkout after last week’s Journal report.\\n\\nThe exodus could get even worse, explained Colleen Ammerman, director of the Gender Initiative at Harvard Business School.\\n\\n“This is something that is very bad for the health of your organization and ultimately for effectiveness,” she said. “You have people who are disengaged in the work. They don't trust leaders. They're more likely to look elsewhere. So you're going to lose talent, and the talent that you retain is probably not going to be performing at its true potential.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nEmployees are calling for change\\n\\nThe Journal’s investigation into Activision Blizzard and Kotick kicked off a firestorm among employees who staged their second walkout of the year to protest the company’s response to accusations of harassment, rape, and discrimination.\\n\\nOn Monday, Activision Blizzard announced that it’s launching a workplace responsibility committee that has the ultimate goal of eliminating harassment and discrimination. But that might not be enough to satisfy workers, who have been calling for change for months.\\n\\nActivision Blizzard employees first walked out in July when the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a suit claiming the “Call of Duty” and “World of Warcraft” maker allowed a culture of sexual harassment to fester unchecked for years.\\n\\nThe suit portrays a company as one that fostered a “fratboy culture” with men groping female colleagues and women being denied promotions and raises. One woman died by suicide due to a relationship with a male supervisor, the complaint alleged. The same woman was also allegedly harassed by other coworkers who shared a nude image of her at a holiday party.\\n\\nAccording to the suit, one employee noted that “women on the Battle.net team were subjected to disparaging comments, the environment was akin to working in a frat house, and that women who were not ‘huge gamers’ or ‘core gamers’ and not into the party scene were excluded and treated as outsiders.”\\n\\nNew allegations have also have surfaced, including one claim that Kotick left an assistant a voicemail in which he threatened to have her killed. That matter, according to The Journal, was later settled out of court. (A spokeswoman for the company told the Journal: “Mr. Kotick quickly apologized 16 years ago for the obviously hyperbolic and inappropriate voice mail, and he deeply regrets the exaggeration and tone in his voice mail to this day.”) LONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 04: Call of Duty: Vanguard launch party at Village Underground on November 04, 2021 in London, England. (Photo by Joe Maher/Getty Images for Vanguard)\\n\\nThe Journal also reported that Kotick failed to tell the board that an employee alleged she'd been raped by her male supervisor. The allegations have increased pressure on Kotick to resign, with employees creating a Change.org petition seeking to build public pressure to oust him. As of Wednesday, the petition has received more than 28,000 signatures.\\n\\nThat petition likely received support from at least some game developers, who arguably have the most crucial roles at Activision Blizzard. And according to Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, the longer Kotick stays in his position, the more difficult it will be for Activision Blizzard to retain or recruit star developers.\\n\\n“The longer he stays, the more likely we'll see very high turnover, if not higher turnover than what we've seen the past couple of years. And that's going to make game development very difficult,” he said.\\n\\nIn an analyst note following the publication of The Journal’s story, Uerkwitz acknowledged that the CEO of a gaming company is more valuable to that company than any one developer. “However, collective development talent is the most important asset by a wide margin to a game company. Erosion of this talent is the biggest key risk to any creative business,” he added. “This risk is currently playing out and accelerating.”\\n\\nIt’s not just employees who are unhappy\\n\\nThe Big Three video game console makers have also come out against Activision Blizzard, telling their workers that they are disturbed by the allegations at the company.\\n\\nAccording to Bloomberg, Sony's (SONY) PlayStation chief Jim Ryan wrote in an email to employees that he and the company’s leadership were “disheartened and frankly stunned” to learn that Activision Blizzard hadn’t done enough to address its problems with harassment and discrimination.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s (MSFT) Xbox head Phil Spencer, meanwhile, told employees via email that he was “disturbed” by the reporting in The Journal’s piece. And FanByte has confirmed that Nintendo of America (NTDOY) head Doug Bowser wrote in an email to staff that he found the accounts in The Journal’s article “distressing and disturbing.” Irvine, CA - July 28: Several hundred Activision Blizzard employees stage a walkout which they say is in a response from company leadership to a lawsuit highlighting alleged harassment, inequality, and more within the company outside the gate at Activision Blizzard headquarters on Wednesday, July 28, 2021 in Irvine, CA. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\\n\\nWith some of Activision Blizzard’s biggest industry partners coming out against it, the firm could face serious consequences. Spencer in particular said that Xbox is evaluating all aspects of its relationship with Activision Blizzard in the wake of The Journal story.\\n\\nAccording to Uerkwitz, a lack of change at Activision Blizzard could hurt the company’s ability to market its games at major events like Sony’s PlayStation Showcase and at the annual E3 conference. So far, Sony seems to have pulled the latest installment of “Call of Duty” from its featured games spot on its sales site.\\n\\n“It's going to be harder to market games. It's going to be harder to make games. And ultimately, Blizzard fans are very passionate. They may choose not to buy games. Reviewers may choose not to review games. So they're potentially in a very precarious spot,” Uerkwitz explained.\\n\\nOf course, Kotick’s removal as CEO wouldn’t change Activision Blizzard overnight. But it would go a long way in proving the company is actually serious about reinventing its broken culture.\\n\\nBy Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\\n\\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn\",\n",
       " 'C3 AI (NYSE:AI) stock has undoubtedly been a losing investment thus far. 3d rendering ai robot think or compute AI stocks\\n\\nSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIt peaked at $180 during last year’s massive tech rally and proceeded to then lose a large chunk of its value. Momentum has left AI stock and a clear negative sentiment has taken root.\\n\\nHowever long-term investors should not lose the forest for the trees. There still remains plenty of reasons to like AI stock.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nC3 AI’s Open Initiative Could Open Doors\\n\\nC3 AI and Shell’s (NYSE:RDS) partnership is starting to bear fruit. In a joint statement, C3 AI and Shell announced three AI products that will be available through the Open AI Energy Initiative. This initiative allows the sharing of AI models for participants in the energy industry. These models include physics-based AI models designed with the intention of improving the reliability and performance of energy assets. These models are built upon the company’s AI suite and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure.\\n\\nThe three new AI models Shell has made available publicly are:\\n\\nShell Process Optimiser for LNG – The model enhances asset production by helping engineers manage key identified optimization levers. Optimum settings are calculated by integrating sensor information, such as pressure, temperature and flow rate. Shell Corrosion Advanced Risk Modelling and Analytics – The model uses data analytics and AI to predict corrosion and degradation before leaks happen. It does this by collecting and analyzing a large amount of onsite data. Shell Autonomous Integrity Recognition – Uses “machine vision” to assist inspectors in identifying and classifying external corrosion and insulation issues before they result in leakages. Inspectors using these tools become more efficient as it reduces time spent troubleshooting issues and paperwork.\\n\\nI like going through what exactly do these products do. C3 AI can sometimes be confusing for investors as its products aren’t straightforward. Therefore, I find it a useful exercise to boil down to the essence of what these AI products actually do and how can this be a benefit to a potential enterprise customer.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n7 Dividend Stocks to Gift to Your Kids (Or Grandkids)\\n\\nAfter reading through examples of what an AI model actually does, it’s easy to see the possible benefits. While focusing on issues in the energy sector, I can see this being adopted by a wide variety of industries.\\n\\nThe challenge of course for any new technology will be adoption. This is the aim of this initiative from C3 AI’s perspective. By making these models available to the wider energy industry, C3 AI is hoping that it would see an uptick in the adoption of its models.\\n\\nStrong Energy Sector to Benefit C3 AI\\n\\nI know that C3 AI’s revenue growth has been sluggish the past few quarters. Certainly not enough to justify a high valuation causing AI stock to downtrend from its all-time highs of $170 all the way down to its current price of less than $38.\\n\\nRecall that C3 AI is heavily dependent on customers from the energy industry. Therefore the downturn of the energy industry in 2020 and the early part of 2021 has really put a hurting on C3 AI’s top-line revenue growth.\\n\\nThe industry recovering in the latter part of 2021 could mean that things might be looking up for C3 AI. Although pulled back from recent highs, Oil prices still remain at five-year highs. This is good news for oil producers who could be seeing windfall profits from the high prices.\\n\\nThere is a potential that the better fortunes at the energy companies could translate to more sales for C3 AI. Enterprise clients may no longer be as constrained with their budget and be willing to invest in AI products to improve the efficiency of their operations.\\n\\nInvestor Takeaway for AI Stock\\n\\nAt this time, AI stock is still in a clear downtrend. I am unsure how long this downtrend may last or what the bottom will eventually be.\\n\\nHowever, as I have indicated before, AI stock is an investment with a 10-year time horizon. I am a firm believer in the potential of C3 AI and the company’s ability to bring AI solutions to the mainstream.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Joseph Nograles held a LONG position in AI.

Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\\n\\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American technology company that creates financial software for small businesses as well as individual consumers. As of Q3, Emerson Point Capital owns $4.6 million worth of shares in the company, which represents 0.69% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.\\n\\nOn November 9, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) gained 12% as Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to Buy while uplifting its price target to $840. In the past year, the stock delivered a 95.4% return to shareholders. In fiscal Q1 2022, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) posted an EPS of $1.53, beating the estimates by $0.56.\\n\\nAt the end of Q3 2021, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), down from 66 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $6.15 billion, compared with $5.3 billion in the previous quarter.

(NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is gaining investors’ attention in 2021.\\n\\nCooper Investors mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“The other meaningful deal during the quarter was Intuit’s acquisition of Mailchimp for $12bn. Intuit has reinvented itself over the last decade and thrived with a leadership position in QuickBooks Online, the financial accounting software for small businesses (effectively the ‘Xero of the US’). We originally invested in Intuit in February 2020, excited by the QuickBooks prospects.\\n\\nManagement have executed exceptionally well on the opportunity set which has seen the shares double since our initial purchase. However, the company has now conducted two meaningful deals in Mailchimp and Credit Karma worth a combined US$20bn over the last 12 months. The investment proposition has shifted from a focus on QuickBooks to now being a financial and small business software conglomerate. We continue to very much admire the company, but with Intuit now trading on 50x forward earnings we no longer see such attractive latency on offer, nor the rewards for the level of execution risk and thus we have exited the position.”\\n\\n9.

The company accounts for 0.71% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the leading shareholder of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the third quarter, owning $3.7 billion worth of shares.\\n\\nRecently, Atlantic Equities noted the strong position of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the Creative Cloud business and upgraded the stock to Overweight, with an $820 price target. In Q3, the company posted an EPS of $3.11, beating the estimates by $0.09. In the past year, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) gained 47.8%.\\n\\nRichie Capital Group mentioned Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Adobe Systems (ADBE – up 24.8%) – In the last 15 years, Adobe has transformed itself into a software behemoth, more than tripling its revenue since 2010. The company is famous for its namesake PDF-reader and photo-editing software Photoshop. However, ADBE sells a full suite of software products through a recurring subscription model. The company transitioned from selling boxed software to recurring subscriptions in 2013 and revenues have grown consistently since. The company achieved $13B in revenue in 2020 with 88% Gross Margins.”\\n\\n8. Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\\n\\nOkta, Inc.

(NASDAQ:OKTA), valued at $2.26 billion. In the previous quarter, 57 hedge funds held stakes in the company, highlighting a positive hedge fund sentiment.\\n\\nLakehouse Capital mentioned Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“The Fund held 20 positions as of the end of June and exited four during the year (including) Okta. The companies we exited were sold almost entirely on the basis of their valuations getting stretched well past their norms and to levels where the return profile no longer offered the asymmetric upside that led us to invest in the first place. We dislike selling on valuation as great growth companies are hard to find and letting winners run is an important facet of a winning growth strategy, however, we’re not gluttons for punishment either and in each of those cases we redeployed capital towards other high-quality growth companies with less demanding valuations.”\\n\\n7. Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 65\\n\\nBill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) is a cloud-based payments company that facilitates its users by offering online business payment solutions.

(NYSE:BILL) to $366, with a Buy rating on the shares.\\n\\n6. Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) as consumer spending is returning to normal after the pandemic.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Amazon has also lagged as its revenue growth is slowing on the very difficult comparisons from last year when this behemoth was growing revenue by over 40%. We still expect exceptional long-term growth and significant margin expansion as the fastest growing (and now large) segments of Amazon are also generating the highest margins.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see Top 5 Tech Stock Picks of Amir Mokari's Emerson Point Capital.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n12 Best Large-cap Biotech Stocks To Buy Now 10 Best Biotech Stocks To Invest In 10 Best Tech Stocks To Invest in Now\\n\\nDisclosure.

In September, Dell said annual revenue would increase 3% to 4% through 2026.\\n\\nFourth-quarter net revenue at rival HP grew over 9%, to around $17 billion.\\n\\nAs in HP’s case, companies looking to upgrade their systems drove Dell revenue.

According to newly released data by the US government, jobless claims in the country have fallen to a 52-week low, consumer spending accelerated by 1.3% in October, and the third quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has been revised upward to around 2.1% after downward revisions in the third quarter.\\n\\nCorporate profits also hit a record high in the last quarter, supported by inventory accumulation as the holiday season approaches and the shopping extravaganza begins. US President Joe Biden recently announced that the government will be releasing 50 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to help contain the rise in oil prices that was leading to greater inflation. Biden has pledged to work with large oil consumers like China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain in this regard.\\n\\nAs the economic outlook evolves, investors might want to get in on the act quickly. Shedding stocks that may prove to be a burden on the portfolio in the coming weeks is a good starting point.\\n\\nMajor companies including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are swiftly changing their strategies to avoid plateaus in their growth and tackle the economic uncertainties caused by supply chain disruptions.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nThese were picked from the database of 867 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the third quarter. The stocks that registered a decrease of at least 20 in the number of hedge funds with stakes in them at the end of September, compared to filings for the end of June, were preferred for the list.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPixabay/Public Domain\\n\\nTop Hedge Funds are Selling These Stocks\\n\\n10. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q3: 242\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q2: 271\\n\\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a diversified technology company with core interests in the ecommerce business. The stock has slumped in recent months after missing market estimates on revenue for the second quarter and antitrust investigations in Europe.\\n\\nHowever, analysts are positive on the long-term prospects of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth has an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $4,350. Despite this, the hedge fund sentiment around the company has turned negative, with top names like Coatue Management, Glenview Capital, and Soros Fund Management slashing their positions recently.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with 3.9 million shares worth more than $12 billion.\\n\\nJust like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), investors are closely watching Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) amid the swiftly changing economic situation.\\n\\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Hayden Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Amazon (AMZN):We sold our last remaining stake in Amazon this quarter. Amazon was our longest-running investment holding, after having originally purchasing it at the inception of Hayden in 2014, at a price of ~$317.\\n\\nI gave some details of how Amazon has progressed over these past 6.5 years in last year’s Q2 2020 letter, which partners can find here (LINK). The company has executed amazingly well over this tenure, with revenues up ~3.3x and since our initial purchase, and reported operating income up ~30x over that period.\\n\\nGenerally, I believe there are three reasons to sell an investment:1) we recognize our initial thesis is wrong (sell out as quick as possible), 2) we have a significantly higher returning opportunity to redeploy the capital into (sell-down to fund the new investment), or 3) the company is maturing and hitting the top part of it’s S-curve / business lifecycle, so the business has fewer places to reinvest its capital internally. As such, the future returns will likely be lower than the past. This investment thus becomes a “source of capital” in the future, as we fund earlier-stage investment opportunities.\\n\\nIn the case of Amazon, we decided to sell due to the third scenario. I’m sure Amazon will continue to generate value for shareholders and continue to keep pace with the broader technology sector. However, I’m just not confident it’s as attractive an investment as when we first invested.\\n\\nWith ~51% of US households having an Amazon Prime account (and with very low churn), each of these households continuing to increase their annual spend with Amazon, and few / no real competitors in sight, Amazon is a dominant force that will only continue to accrue value as consumers continue to move from offline to online purchases for their everyday needs. Likewise, the “cash-flow machine” of Amazon Web Services is in a similar position of strength, with AWS now having ~32% market share and continuing to grow at +30% y/y. Because of this, I think Amazon is probably one of the safest investments in the technology sector today.\\n\\nSo why did we decide to sell the investment then? Simply put, Amazon is …”read the entire letter here]\\n\\n9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q3: 123\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q2: 143\\n\\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a payments technology firm based in California. The stock has suffered amid a broader lull around the payments industry in general over the past few weeks. On November 22, the share price of PayPal fell to a 52-week low.\\n\\nUBS analyst Rayna Kumar recently assumed coverage of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $263, noting that the pullback in share price was a “buying opportunity” for investors.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 123 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $12.8 billion in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), down from 143 in the preceding quarter worth $16.3 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q4 2020 investor letter, Polen Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“For the full year 2020, one of the top performers was PayPal, which we purchased in 2019, the company continues to take market share in digital payments and has seen an acceleration in user adoption and engagement, especially within their “silver tech” or older user demographic. We expect many more years of ongoing double-digit growth from their various business segments and new initiatives.”\\n\\n8. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q3: 115\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q2: 146\\n\\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a technology infrastructure and marketing firm. It is one of the many dual-listed companies that have been hammered amid a Chinese government crackdown against big tech and cross-border payment flows.\\n\\nArgus analyst Jim Kelleher recently downgraded Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stock to Hold from Buy, underlining that there was increased competition for the company in China and lower domestic consumption.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) with 14 million shares worth more than $2 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Alibaba also detracted from performance as the company continues to remain under regulatory scrutiny from both the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation on antitrust concerns and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on ADR listing requirements. Despite the regulatory overhang, we believe that Alibaba’s competitive positioning and growth outlook remains intact, even if the company must pay fines or modify some business practices. We viewed the current valuation at <20x next twelve month’s earnings as a compelling opportunity to add to our position. Alibaba is the second largest position in the Portfolio.”\\n\\n7. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q3: 63\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders in Q2: 87\\n\\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) makes and sells memory and storage products. Pricing concerns and guidance that fell short of expectations in the third quarter earnings report are some of the headwinds facing the company.\\n\\nAnalysts continue to be bullish about the future of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral and raised the price target to $95 from $75, noting that server demand would improve in the coming months.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 63 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $3.8 billion in Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), down from 87 in the preceding quarter worth $6.3 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Bonsai Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Micron is a manufacturer of memory semiconductor chips. Micron appreciated 17.3% during the quarter.\\n\\nWith the semiconductor cycle in full swing, sentiment continued to improve for major DRAM and NAND suppliers. Spot pricing for DRAM continues its upward march due to supply shocks across the industry and sustained demand levels that continue to outstrip supply.\\n\\nAs a result, Micron showed improving results for the fiscal first quarter, raised guidance intra-quarter for the fiscal second quarter, and offered strong guidance for the fiscal third quarter in both growth and margins.\\n\\nWhile the cyclical nature of DRAM hasn’t changed, the cycles themselves continue to become more benign, leading to long-term economic improvement across these businesses. Micron is now continuously profitable, with industry players in a dramatically stronger position than even just five years ago.\\n\\nThe biggest negative surprise in the quarter came from Micron’s exit from its 3D XPoint hybrid memory business. The company also announced its decision to sell its accompanying Utah fab. Fortunately, this development does not alter the investment thesis much since 3D XPoint was an option ticket for future growth. While it’s unfortunate this product didn’t pan out, now is an excellent time to sell a fab, so perhaps it is a blessing in disguise?”\\n\\n6.

The pandemic was the single most influential factor in pushing these traders towards the market. According to a survey by financial services firm Charles Schwab, 15% of active retail traders got their start at the market in 2020. Most of these traders use online brokerage applications like Robinhood to make trades.\\n\\nCharles Schwab itself hosts over 30 million of these retail clients and has boosted assets to close to $7 trillion in this retail trading boom. Fidelity Investments, another brokerage, had over $8.8 trillion in customer assets in late 2020, up from $8.3 trillion in 2019, because of the influx of retail investors on the platform. Many retail investors use internet platforms like Reddit to exchange ideas. Since the short squeeze saga involving GameStop and AMC Entertainment in January, Reddit forums related to finance have gained in importance on Wall Street.\\n\\nThese retail investors like to invest in high-growth equities as they dream of getting rich quickly. However, so far this year, inflation concerns have dampened the hopes of a quick economic recovery from the virus, increasing interest in value plays as growth stocks undergo a correction.

(NASDAQ:ACAD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. was among the top detractors from performance. Acadia Pharmaceuticals develops and commercializes small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs associated with central nervous system disorders. Acadia’s Nuplazid (Pimavansenn) is marketed for treating hallucinations and delusions that accompany Parkinson’ s disease psychosis. Additionally, Nuplazid is being developed to treat hallucinations and delusions related to dementia. The price of Acadia shares fell significantly in response to an FDA notification on March 3 that the agency had identified deficiencies in the drug’ s supplemental new drug application that currently preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements.”\\n\\n7.

The company has failed to impress the market with earnings over the last two quarters and admitted that “short-term” headwinds were causing a minor blip in performance.\\n\\nBradesco BBI analyst Otavio Tanganelli recently downgraded StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ: STNE) stock to Underperform from Neutral and lowered the price target to $17 from $49, noting that near-term margins for the firm would likely compress in the coming months.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 37 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.2 billion in StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), down from 44 the preceding quarter worth $2.7 billion.\\n\\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ: STNE) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are viewing with caution.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, JDP Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“StoneCo (NYSE: STNE) has been in our portfolio since early 2019 and has appreciated 225% since. In the first half of 2021 the stock was down nearly 20% and was a drag on the fund’s performance.\\n\\nStone is a leading fintec company in Brazil that provides back-office software, loans and other financial services to small and medium sized businesses (SMBs). We have discussed Stone in past letters and the company’s “ladder up” from a card processor to a supplier of enterprise software used to sell financial products on top of such as working capital loans.\\n\\nThe company generates a lot of cash that it reinvests to acquire or build new financial products for its customer base. Since we invested, the company has grown the number of SMB clients by 3x, revenue by 2.3x, and net income by 2.2×11.\\n\\nThe pandemic’s impact on SMBs in Brazil has been severe, especially for the many retailers who are only now adopting an e-commerce strategy. In the first half of 2021 Stone increased loss provisions on its lending product, and overall growth has slowed somewhat. The stock’s decline earlier this year was not surprising, but investors are now ignoring progress that has enhanced Stone’s position for coming out much stronger when the recovery begins.\\n\\nStoneCo Q1 2021 Earnings Call: “Based on (i) our learnings with lockdowns last year, (ii) recent client transactional data and (iii) learnings from the dynamics of countries where vaccines are widespread, we expect that once vaccination scale (which we think will happen in the second half of 2021), the economic recovery will be fast and – although delayed – Brazil is moving in the right direction. For these reasons, we have made an informed decision to be ready for recovery by investing in growth…”\\n\\n“…In the first quarter, we decided to increase our salesforce headcount by 24%, marketing investments by 33%, customer service and logistics headcount by 32% and technology headcount by 20% in order to be the fastest player when our economy comes back to normal levels.”\\n\\n“I want to start our presentation by highlighting that Brazil went through a second wave of COVID in the first quarter of ’21, which imposed commerce restrictions in several cities throughout the country. Those restrictions were felt by our clients with average TVP reaching a low in the end of March…\\n\\n…But similar to the behavior we saw in the comeback from the first lockdown in 2020, we already observed significant and quick recovery with average TPV in May achieving levels above January 2021. As Thiago mentioned, we expect that once vaccinations are scaled, the economy recovery of the country will be fast.”\\n\\nIn terms of COVID recovery opportunities within our portfolio, Stone might be the most “coiled” because the impact on Brazilian small businesses has been so traumatic. In addition, Stone is part of a much larger and fast-moving transition happening in Brazil around the digitalization of financial services. The speed of this transition is unique to Brazil because the Central Bank is actively trying to reduce the country’s previous dependency on a small handful of large banks. Important progress in the first half of 2021 included closing on the long-awaited acquisition of Linx, a mature provider of enterprise software with a large footprint across Brazil. The acquisition will provide Stone meaningful cross-selling opportunities and a more diversified customer base.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Reddit Stocks that Flopped in 2021.\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n12 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy Now 15 Best Financial Stocks to Buy Now 15 Best Utility Stocks to Invest In\\n\\nDisclosure.

The company is also witnessing growth in user base of its different applications including Microsoft 365 suite, Dynamics and Power Platform.\\n\\nHowever, Microsoft expects Surface revenues to decline in the fiscal second quarter owing to supply chain disruptions.

       " \"In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 dividend stocks to buy and hold. To skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold.\\n\\nApart from typical blue chip stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), dividend stocks can also be looked at as a smart investment vehicle. A recent Global X report shows why, by primarily looking at higher-yielding dividend stocks. The report focuses on the expected performance of dividend stocks in rising rate environments. It builds its conclusions on strong evidence collected by observing the performance of said stocks from 1960 to 2017, lending the report great credibility.\\n\\nBased on intuition, it can be seen that rising interest rates in the US can lead to investor concern when it comes to the market. As such, many are drawn to dividend stocks as active hedges in their portfolios. The report found evidence to back up this perception of dividend stocks as good investments in rising interest rate environments particularly when they are higher-yielding stocks. High dividend stocks were reported to have generated an average annual dividend yield of 6.4%, firstly.\\n\\nSecondly, the total return of these stocks also outperformed the S&P 500 by about 3% on an annualized basis. And lastly, in 7 interest rate periods out of the 10 under study since 1960, these dividend stocks were also overwhelmingly outperforming the S&P 500 as a matter of fact.\\n\\nWhen considering whether or not it's still profitable to invest in dividend stocks, one can often be at a standstill. However, a recent Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data shows that about 3,394 global companies will be paying out about $1.37 trillion to their shareholders in dividends in 2021. The companies all have market capitalization of at least $1 billion. Of these companies and their dividends, US dividends are expected to see an 8.6% increase in 2021, growing to about $562.3 billion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHence, despite the slow growth and even the downfall of dividend stocks in 2020 and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it can now be said that dividend stocks are beginning to regain their charm and their profitability for individual shareholders.\\n\\nApart from what's already been stated, more evidence to substantiate this claim comes from Janus Henderson's statements in a November report that 90% of global companies raised their dividends or held them steady so far in 2021. The report also mentioned that these global companies delivered about $403.5 billion in the third quarter of 2021, showcasing a 22% increase compared to the amount generated in the third quarter of 2020.\\n\\nPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on Unsplash\\n\\nWithout further ado, let's take a look at the 10 dividend stocks to buy and hold.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nInsider Monkey tracks the data of about 867 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2021, and we have used this data to pick dividend stocks that are highly popular among hedge funds today.

The Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL) logo on the side of a building.\\n\\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI don’t own Alphabet. I have worried about regulators. I accused it of being run in a Wall Street way, rather than as a Silicon Valley company.\\n\\nDespite my protests, Alphabet stock is up 68% this year. What wasn’t a trillion-dollar stock in 2020 sports a $2 trillion market capitalization at the end of 2021.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe gain even beat mighty Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 53%. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is up 25% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up 21%, but they were left in the dust. What’s now Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) is up just 10%.\\n\\nBut you don’t buy yesterday. You buy tomorrow. Analysts tracked by TipRanks see Alphabet managing only a Facebook-like 14% gain next year. Why?\\n\\nGOOGL Stock’s Now King of All Media Names\\n\\nWhat powered GOOGL stock in 2021 was advertising. Combined, Google search and YouTube ads represented 80% of its revenue in the third quarter, and all its net income. (Other operations, including its Google Cloud service, lost money.)\\n\\n7 EV Stocks Set to Soar as the Infrastructure Bill Passes\\n\\nSearch and YouTube operate in a symbiotic way. TV ads, on the YouTube site and the YouTube TV cable replacement service, deliver branding messages. Search ads, especially promoted results, deliver direct response. These ads can be precisely targeted, practically to the individual.\\n\\nThe power of this one-two punch has destroyed all other advertising media. Journalism in the 20th century meant aggregating a place, industry or lifestyle, then getting a premium price for the audience. With Alphabet, you get precise targeting for a base rate. TV is now threatened because YouTube has plenty of inventory, and search can close the sale.\\n\\nCloud Creates Secret Sauce\\n\\nAdvertising is how Google monetizes its cloud, but the cloud remains its secret sauce.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAlphabet puts $20 billion a year into its cloud data centers. The cash comes from operating cash flow, $25.5 billion in the third quarter alone.\\n\\nIt’s the cloud that makes Alphabet’s advertising and media dominance possible. The Android operating system, which takes cloud directly onto devices, means it’s not hurt by Apple’s recent privacy changes.\\n\\nFor analysts who worry about the sustainability of the model, Google points to revenue raises at Google Cloud. Google Cloud, however, continues to lose money, $645 million in the most recent quarter. It’s also not gaining market share. Google Cloud’s market share remains in single digits in the U.S. Amazon has a third of the market thanks to a seven-year head start.\\n\\nAdvertising lets Google cover up Google Cloud’s relative failure. Synergy Researchestimates Google’s global share of the cloud infrastructure market is 10%. That’s with trailing 12-month revenue for the whole market at $164 billion, growing at almost 27% per year.\\n\\nThe growth of cloud services gives analysts confidence that Google can resist regulatory pressure on its ad operations. This is supported by Google moving to charge for more services, even cloud storage that costs it virtually nothing. A nominal monthly fee, a customer connection, also protects against regulators.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nGoogle swallowed journalism, and all its paid content models, in the first decade of the century. It’s now swallowing traditional TV.\\n\\nIt’s doing all this while paying almost nothing, except for cloud capital spending.

       " \"In this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Jain’s history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to the Top 5 Stock Picks of Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners.\\n\\nRajiv Jain founded GQG Partners in June 2016, and currently serves as the chairman, chief investment officer, and portfolio manager at the investment firm. In a relatively short span of time, Jain has managed to accumulate a diverse team of more than 100 employees, over $34 billion in managed 13F securities, and assets under management worth $66.7 billion, as of the second quarter.\\n\\nBefore establishing GQG Partners, Jain started his investment career with Vontobel Asset Management in 1994 as a portfolio manager, and stayed with the firm for almost 22 years. In his tenure at Vontobel Asset Management, Jain served as the chief investment officer and Co-CEO, in addition to being the portfolio manager for international equities strategy, emerging markets equities strategy, and global equities strategy.\\n\\nAt GQG Partners, Jain has a diverse portfolio comprising separately managed accounts, private funds, US mutual funds, UCITS funds, Australian funds, as well as CITs. He actively manages the long-only equity strategies at the firm, with his exceptional team handling the rest. As of June this year, Jain’s investment portfolio is concentrated with stocks from the materials, information technology, finance, healthcare, energy, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors.\\n\\nAs of the second quarter’s 13F filings, Jain bought stakes in 23 new stocks, made additional purchases in 37 equities, sold out of 10, and reduced holdings in 18 stocks. GQG Partners’ top buys as of Q2 were Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Whereas, he reduced holdings in JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), among others.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe most notable stocks in Jain’s Q2 portfolio are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), among others discussed at length below. These stocks are highly sought-after by the smart money as well.  Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWe used the Q2 portfolio of Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners to compile this list, using his stake value in each holding to rank these stocks.\\n\\nThe analyst ratings and earnings for each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was gauged using the data of 873 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, as of June this year.\\n\\nTop Stock Picks of Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners\\n\\n10. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\\n\\nGQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,163,957,000\\n\\nPercentage of GQG Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 3.42%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 46\\n\\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a Swiss-American cigarette and tobacco manufacturing multinational corporation that serves customers in more than 180 countries with its tobacco products. With flagship brands like Marlboro, Bond Street, and Benson & Hedges, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is referred to as a Big Tobacco company. Jain’s GQG Partners holds a $1.16 billion stake in the company, which represents 3.42% of the firm’s stock portfolio as of June this year.\\n\\nFinancial Times revealed in a November 9 story that the merger which was once discussed between tobacco giants, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), and has been making headlines since 2019, is now off the table. CEO Jacek Olczak of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stated that instead of the $200 billion merger with the fellow tobacco group, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is looking to enhance its pharmaceutical and therapeutic knowledge, and might expand into the CBD market in the future.\\n\\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) posted its Q3 results on October 19. EPS in the period equaled $1.58, exceeding estimates by $0.02. Revenue for the quarter came in at $8.12 billion, beating estimates by $175.15 million.\\n\\nAs of June this year, of the 873 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 46 funds were long Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), down from 48 in the preceding quarter.\\n\\nHere is what Broyhill Asset Management has to say about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Philip Morris (PM) shook off the prospects of a ban on menthol and a potential cap on nicotine and gained 23%. We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are available here.\\n\\n‘PM Valuation. PM is up ~ 15% YTD and would have the most to gain under a nicotine cap. A cap would likely accelerate conversion to iQOS, which is 100% incremental for PM (PM also has zero exposure to combustible cigarettes in the U.S. and licenses its IQOS product for MO to distribute domestically). As such, the decline in PM was much more muted, with the stock hitting new 52 week highs a day after the Biden headline, driven by yesterday’s earnings release. It didn’t take long for investors to shift their attention back to fundamentals and the fundamentals here are best in class. In short, results beat estimates across the board (a recurring theme here), and management raised guidance for the full year (another recurring theme). IQOS continued to deliver impressive growth, recording continued market share gains on the heels of continued user acquisition growth, up 1.5M to 19.1M total users. Importantly, IQOS now represents nearly 30% of PM net revenues (management expects “smoke-free” products to represent more than half of their business by 2025, which should make the ESG folks happy), which is driving top-line growth and margin expansion. Hard to believe that they have created a product with higher margins than combustible cigarettes!! We expect PM operating margins to increase by 100bps – 200bps annually as IQOS continues to gain share. The stock trades at ~ 15x today or 2/3 of the market’s multiple for a business likely to generate $35B in cash flow – or 25% of the market cap – in just the next three years. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 18x and within a range of ~ 14x – 22x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 5.1% at the current price, and we expect management to resume share purchases in the back half of this year.'”\\n\\n9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\\n\\nGQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,206,223,000\\n\\nPercentage of GQG Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 3.54%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\\n\\nGQG Partners owns over 29 million shares in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), which are valued at $1.2 billion. It is one of the top stocks in Jain’s Q2 portfolio, representing 3.54% of the securities at GQG Partners. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a multinational financial services company, which offers investment banking, asset management, commodities trading, insurance, and private equity, among other financial services.\\n\\nReuters reported on November 1 that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is planning to set up a securities firm in China, to tap into the lucrative Chinese capital market. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) will gain regulatory approval for this move by the beginning of 2022, and the financial services multinational corporation will as a result be eligible for trading, underwriting stocks and bonds, as well as other functions. After JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is another American financial giant set to benefit from the multi trillion dollar Chinese financial sector.\\n\\nOn October 14, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) published its Q3 earnings. EPS for the period beat expectations by $0.15, coming in at $0.85. Revenue for Q3 totaled $22.77 billion, beating estimates by $1.16 billion. David George from the investment advisory firm Baird downgraded Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) from Neutral to Underperform, citing the stock’s unattractive risk/reward and higher market competition. On November 1, the Baird analyst kept a $42 price target on the shares.\\n\\nAs of the second quarter of 2021, 87 hedge funds tracked within the database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), down from 97 in the preceding quarter.\\n\\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Earlier this year, one of our holdings, Bank of America, announced that it was raising its minimum hourly wage from $15 to $20 and would increase it to $25 by 2025. The company received great press for placing the well-being of its employees above profits. But was it really either/or? Bank of America’s chief human resources officer spoke to the bigger picture: “A core tenet of responsible growth is our commitment to being a great place to work…that includes providing strong pay and competitive benefits to help them and their families, so that we continue to attract and retain the best talent.” Bank of America understood that engaged, high-caliber employees are more productive, less prone to turnover and, therefore, less expensive in the long run. Increasing the pay for employees wasn’t elevating employees above shareholders; it was the right thing to do for employees and for shareholders.\\n\\nIf an increase to $20 was good, why stop there? Why not $50 per hour? Because the benefits the business receives at $50 don’t justify the expense. The bank would no longer be able to price its products competitively and would lose business. The employees would “win” in the short term, but eventually the lost business would lead to job cuts, meaning both employees and shareholders would lose. The negative effects of stakeholder overreach are no different than when CEOs overreach to inflate short-term profits. Both hurt shareholders and stakeholders.”\\n\\n8. Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY)\\n\\nGQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,206,521,000\\n\\nPercentage of GQG Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 3.54%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\\n\\nInfosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) is an Indian multinational tech company that offers business consulting and outsourcing services to customers. Headquartered in Bangalore, it serves customers around the world. Rajiv Jain owns over 56.95 million shares in Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY), worth $1.2 billion as of June this year, representing 3.54% of GQG Partners’ investment portfolio.\\n\\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc (NYSE:RDS) announced on November 3 that it will collaborate with Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) to launch “Shell Inventory Optimizer”, which would be an exclusive product offered to its customers. Shell Inventory Optimizer utilizes AI and allows businesses to manage and optimize inventory levels on the basis of historical usage. It improves demand planning, and optimizes time and labor hours to cut down on costs and make operations effective.\\n\\nInfosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) reported Q3 results on October 13. EPS in the period totaled $0.17, which met analysts’ expectations. Revenue for the quarter came in at $3.93 billion, beating estimates by $41.20 million.\\n\\nAs of the second quarter, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY), with stakes worth $2.1 billion.\\n\\nIn addition to Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) is a notable stock in Jain’s Q2 portfolio.\\n\\n7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)\\n\\nGQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,430,396,000\\n\\nPercentage of GQG Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 4.20%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\\n\\nTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) represents 4.20% of GQG Partners’ Q2 portfolio, making it one of Rajiv Jain’s top stock picks. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a retail corporation that has established itself as a cheap-chic player in the United States. It offers beauty and health products, home accessories, electronics, food, and other consumer goods.\\n\\nAs of June this year, 66 hedge funds tracked by the database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), worth $5.86 billion. This is compared to 60 hedge funds in the first quarter, with an approximate stake value of $4.76 billion.\\n\\nKate McShane, a Goldman Sachs analyst, on October 18, removed Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) from the firm’s Conviction List but kept a Buy rating on the stock. The price target was set at $308, raised from $281. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) achieved strong sales and income growth, but according to the analyst, the revenue growth would slow down in 2022, in line with historical levels.\\n\\nHere is what Nelson Capital Management has to say about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“We added Target (tkr: TGT) to our consumer staples sector. Target offers a broad array of products in owned and known brand items at affordable prices. Its omni-channel fulfilment centers allow customers to receive their items via in-store pickup, curbside pickup, same-day shipping and regular shipping while simultaneously reducing operating costs. With a significantly lower valuation than peers and a unique operating strategy, Target is an attractive holding.”\\n\\n6. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\\n\\nGQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,483,009,000\\n\\nPercentage of GQG Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 4.35%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\\n\\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a multinational healthcare and insurance company from Minnesota.

(NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a notable stock in Jain’s Q2 portfolio.\\n\\n\\u200b\\u200bHere is what Third Point Management has to say about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“UnitedHealth is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world and a market leader in both its insurance and healthcare services (Optum) businesses. We initiated our position during the 2020 Presidential election at a time of heightened political and regulatory uncertainty.\\n\\nWe believe under its new CEO, Andrew Witty, UnitedHealth can not only preserve its market dominance and sustain industry-leading growth rates across most of its key segments but also enter new healthcare services markets. Witty is known as a mission-driven CEO who clearly articulates his view that providing high-quality, affordable health care services is a social good. He receives consistently high marks from former colleagues, and we believe that his leadership approach will ballast and even strengthen UNH’s already impressive management and employee ranks. The insurance and services businesses are synergistic and complementary, which entrenches United’s critical role in care financing, access, and management. This dynamic gives us confidence in the durability of United’s market leadership…” (Click here to see the full text)\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see Top 5 Stock Picks of Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n10 Cheap Pharmaceutical Stocks to Watch Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Jeff Ubben's ValueAct Capital 10 Stocks to Buy According to Bluegrass Capital Partners\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

Activision Blizzard (ATVI) logo displayed on the screen of a mobile phone\\n\\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBlame is being assigned to CEO Bobby Kotick, and a long-running sexual harassment scandal he either ignored or covered up.\\n\\nThe stock’s fall went into overdrive when Blizzard co-head Jen Oneal, ATVI’s highest-ranking female executive, abruptly resigned. She had been in her position just three months.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nKotick has offered to take a huge pay cut and has absolute control over his board, but Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now “reevaluating” its relationship with the company. This is seen as exerting pressure to force Kotick out.\\n\\nWhile the scandal has bargain hunters calling ATVI stock oversold it may be time to take another look at its business model.\\n\\nA Closer Look at ATVI Stock\\n\\nFor over a decade, video gaming has represented the ultimate in client computing.\\n\\nGamers bought the fastest machines, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) graphics cards. Game software constantly pushed the technology envelope.\\n\\n7 EV Stocks Set to Soar as the Infrastructure Bill Passes\\n\\nGame development environments like Unity Software (NYSE:U), Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) and privately-held Epic Games’ Unreal Engine pushed development costs past those of Hollywood blockbusters.\\n\\nThere are now movie franchises based entirely on games, like Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.\\n\\nBut as entertainment genres have merged, the technology has broken out of its box. Gaming has given rise to the “metaverse,” bringing it into office and online interaction.\\n\\nAnalysts confidently talk about the metaverse being a $1 trillion market before the end of the decade. Among the seen layers of this market, gaming is just an edge case.\\n\\nMicrosoft is now operating on every level of the new market. Facebook became Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) to focus on the new market.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nActivision Blizzard, which a few years ago was a big fish in the gaming pond, now finds itself a goldfish in the metaverse ocean. That spells trouble for ATVI stock.\\n\\nCan ATVI Survive?\\n\\nGiven the new reality, Microsoft’s re-evaluation could force Kotick out. The company must then decide what it wants to be in the metaverse. Below Kotick, its executive talent is thin.\\n\\nAt its current market cap of $48 billion, Activision Blizzard is worth more than twice ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC). It’s still worth more than its chief rival, Electronic Arts (NYSE:EA). But EA has a host of new titles coming out next year, while ATVI’s have been delayed.\\n\\nWhile game development budgets have grown, developers still rely on the fickle loyalty of game players for their revenue.\\n\\nMany players are unhappy with policies Kotick helped develop, like charging for “add-on packs” and in-game purchases that drain their bank accounts.\\n\\nGrowth in some new segments, like e-sports, is slowing. ATVI’s expected 2022 growth is coming from titles that are being delayed.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThe company Bobby Kotick built was a dominant video game publisher. It had control over its market. In the new business environment of the metaverse, ATVI is a niche player.\\n\\nThe scandals, and game delays, have knocked ATVI’s price to earnings multiple down to just 18. This is bringing in value investors as chart-watchers wait for signs of a bottom.\\n\\nBut the best reason I can see to buy ATVI stock today is arbitrage.\\n\\nThe company’s intellectual property might look nice inside Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). Disney could spin out titles it has problems with and keep the talent to lead its own metaverse efforts.\\n\\nWarner Discovery might like ATVI stock to water down AT&T’s (NYSE:T) stake. A bidding war could even bring Cloud Czars like Meta Platforms and Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to the party.\\n\\nIt’s speculative, but you could cash in on a Kotick cash out.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in AMZN, NVDA and MSFT.

A racecar featuring Drive PX 2 technology from Nvidia (NVDA) parked.\\n\\nSource: Steve Lagreca / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nNVDA stock has gained 18% since the company announced its third-quarter results on Nov. 17.\\n\\nThe latest increase brings Nvidia stock’s total gains for this year to 162%. Over the last month alone, the company’s share price has risen 51% and now trades at $343.80.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nAmong technology stocks, and chip designers in particular, Nvidia has been a hands down winner this year.\\n\\nThe stock has returned so much value to shareholders that CNBC commentator Jim Cramer has even named one of his dogs after the company.\\n\\nDespite the incredible growth, many analysts who follow the company see even more gains ahead.\\n\\nA Closer Look at NVDA Stock\\n\\nThe latest run on NVDA stock comes after the Silicon Valley leader printed third-quarter results that once again beat the consensus view of Wall Street analysts, and provided a bullish outlook for revenue in the current fourth quarter.\\n\\nSpecifically, Nvidia reported earnings of $1.17 per share versus $1.11 that was expected, up 60% from a year earlier.\\n\\n7 Dividend Stocks to Gift to Your Kids (Or Grandkids)\\n\\nThe company’s revenue amounted to $7.10 billion compared to $6.82 billion that was expected, up 50% from the same period of 2020.\\n\\nWhile analysts cheered the Q3 numbers, they especially liked that Nvidia said it expects to report $7.4 billion of revenue in the current quarter, higher than analysts’ consensus forecast of $6.86 billion.\\n\\nNvidia has topped analyst estimates for earnings consistently over the last five years and has now beaten Wall Street revenue estimates for 10 consecutive quarters.\\n\\nKeeping the impressive win streak going is the fact that the company has had more demand than it can fulfill for its various chips, semiconductors and graphics cards.\\n\\nOf particular interest are its “GeForce” graphics card that is used in video game consoles and personal computers (PCs).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGaming, which remains Nvidia’s biggest market, reported $3.2 billion in Q3 sales, up 42% from $2.27 billion in the same quarter of last year.\\n\\nAdditionally, Nvidia has made strides in bolstering its data center business, where cloud providers and enterprises are turning to the kind of graphics processors made by Nvidia for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\\n\\nNvidia reported $2.9 billion in data center sales during the third quarter, which was up 55% from $1.9 billion in the same quarter of 2020.\\n\\nNvidia said the growth was driven by GPU sales to cloud providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\\n\\nOverall, the incredible results have served to reinforce the confidence investors have in Nvidia and its products.\\n\\nSome Issues With Nvidia\\n\\nDespite all of its success, Nvidia is not without some ongoing issues that it is managing. The company continues to try and conclude its $40 billion purchase of Arm, a British company that specializes in mobile semiconductor technology.\\n\\nThe deal has encountered some hiccups. The British government announced on Nov. 16 that its Competition and Markets Authority will investigate antitrust concerns and national security issues related to the deal.\\n\\nThis comes after the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the transaction in October.\\n\\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also expressed concerns about the transaction and what it could mean for competition in the chip sector.\\n\\nThe ongoing investigations of the Arm deal coupled with Nvidia’s strong results and growing dominance in the semiconductor space have led some analysts to declare that the acquisition of Arm will be torpedoed by regulators around the world.\\n\\nNvidia’s senior leadership team has softened its language around the Arm deal in recent months, perhaps in an effort to mute expectations for the acquisition’s approval. For now, the purchase of Arm remains a lingering question mark for the company.\\n\\nAdditionally, Nvidia continues to grapple with a global shortage of semiconductors and delays in the manufacturing of its chips, which it outsources. However, to date, those issues only seem to have intensified demand for the company’s various products.\\n\\nLastly, Nvidia has seen enthusiasm for its foray into cryptocurrency cool in recent months.\\n\\nThe company came out with dedicated graphics cards that can be used specifically for cryptocurrency mining earlier this year.\\n\\nThe move was intended to help meet some of the demand it was seeing from people who use their computers to mine for Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) and other digital assets.\\n\\nThere was hope that the cryptocurrency graphics cards would be a hit, but Nvidia said that in Q3 it had sold $105 million of the cards, down from $266 million in the previous quarter and that sales had been slowing sharply.\\n\\nBuy and Hold NVDA Stock\\n\\nDespite the global chip shortage and its ongoing efforts to acquire Arm, Nvidia is a company that is firing on all cylinders. This fact is reflected in the share price that has more than doubled year to date.\\n\\nAdd in that Nvidia also pays a healthy dividend (it doled out $100 million in dividends during the third quarter alone) and there’s plenty of reason to be bullish on the stock.\\n\\nAmong the 39 analysts providing 12-month price forecasts for Nvidia, the median price target on the shares is $350. It trades at around $326 today.\\n\\nThis is after the share price has already run up more than 150% this year. Among technology companies, Nvidia is best of breed and running ahead of the pack. NVDA stock is a buy.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, MSFT and GOOGL.

       " 'Last Friday was a bad way to end a great holiday break. The S&P 500 tanked 2.27% on news that a discovered COVID-19 variant called Omicron could threaten the economic recovery and lead to more lockdowns and travel restrictions.\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nIt will be a few weeks before we know for sure what to expect from the variant and how current vaccines will fare against the virus, which means prices are likely to remain volatile and choppy this week at a minimum.\\n\\nThis has already been a pretty good year for stocks, so investors taking some profits off the table would not be a surprise, and that could compound some short-term selling before Wednesday.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nHowever, because the data we have right now is still very positive, we recommend going with the historical odds rather than running from the market.\\n\\nDoes a big daily loss like this tell us anything about the next 30 days? Is this a good buying opportunity or should traders hang back and wait for the market to consolidate at support? We have been studying the market for 20 years, and history can help set our expectations if we take a closer look at the numbers.\\n\\nAvoid This Mistake AND Get $1,375 Instant Cash Payouts?\\n\\nOver the last 12 years, there have been 107 days where the market lost more than -2%, and those losses have been followed by a positive return over the next 30-day period 75.7% of the time.\\n\\nThe average profit for the month following a big day to the downside is +2.918%, which may not sound like much, but helps put Friday’s market volatility in perspective.\\n\\nWhat to Do Now\\n\\nIt is unlikely that Friday’s selling will be the end of any bearishness. We think that this week will continue to be choppy while traders settle down and we all wait to get a little more information about the new COVID variant.\\n\\nHowever, later this week, we recommend looking at this pullback as a buying opportunity once prices have started to slow. A bearish market drives interest rates lower which makes this an ideal time to consider tech, real estate, and retail.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe like:\\n\\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT): As in prior updates over the last few weeks, we still think this is a winner, and if there is to be more distance work/learning due to COVID, then demand for MSFT’s collaboration software and cloud services will remain strong. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE): Like MSFT, ADBE is a big player in collaboration and subscription software that will be in even more demand if traders want to hedge against business travel restrictions. Prices between $620 and $640 look like a strong buy to us. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY): eBay has been able to hold onto the edge it developed during the pandemic last year, and more online retail spending is only likely to send the stock higher. Any dips below $70 per share are a great buy opportunity.\\n\\nShould You Buy Pandemic Stocks?\\n\\nThe short answer to the pandemic stocks question is: no… and yes.\\n\\nWhen traders think about stocks that did well in the pandemic, the first names that come to mind are Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Chegg Inc. (NYSE:CHGG), Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON), and similar firms.\\n\\nHowever, these stocks were unable to hold onto their gains when travel restrictions started to ebb, and the stocks tanked. For example, ZM is down 60% from its pandemic highs, and big institutional investors are unlikely to want to jump right back into the big names from the pandemic.\\n\\nStill get trading ideas from Reddit? There’s a much better way…\\n\\nFor now, we recommend steering clear of the ZM, CHGG, PTON, Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU), and Logitech International S.A. (NASDAQ:LOGI) crowd. Any gains in that group are likely to evaporate quickly if the variant news is less bad than expected.\\n\\nHowever, stocks like Microsoft, Adobe, eBay, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), have done very well defending their gains from the pandemic and will attract the big investors who want to hedge against risks again this time.\\n\\nWe also recommend adding to your list a few retail firms that never gained a rep for being a “pandemic stock” but were able to leverage and hold their position over the last two years to grab more market share. In addition to eBay and Amazon, we would include Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) on that list.\\n\\nFrom a pandemic/retail perspective, BBY is risky, but we think they may also offer the best short-term returns of the bunch. BBY reported earnings earlier last week and tanked despite crushing estimates because costs are rising, however, online sales are higher margin, and management is responding well to improving in-store sales.\\n\\nWhat Else is Coming?\\n\\nNews about the pandemic will likely dominate the market all week, however, there are a few highlights to look out for.\\n\\nThe monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is due on Friday, and it will be a market mover. When we compare the official reports (full of guestimates) over the last few months with the data being reported during earnings season, we still feel that the BLS has been undercounting jobs and could make a big correction this month.\\n\\nThe BLS does its best to reconcile the data gathered through surveys with seasonality adjustments and their own best estimates of hiring. However, over- or under-counting can happen when there are so many unique factors. In our view, a surprise to the upside seems very likely, which could come at the perfect time to push the market higher on Friday.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\nIf you thought Friday’s selling was bad for stocks, just look at oil prices. WTI Crude dropped 13% on Friday, bringing it down to the prices we went on record saying were inflated back in September. It seems likely that OPEC will try to boost prices by reducing supply, but pandemic fears will probably overwhelm anything the big producers try to do in the short term.\\n\\nFor now, we recommend staying clear of energy stocks. However, if worries about the new variant fade quickly, there could be some discounted stocks in the group. But that is a conversation for when prices start to settle down.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJohn Jagerson & Wade Hansen\\r\\n Editors, Trading Opportunities\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nStock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Now Man Who Called Black Monday: “Prepare Now.” #1 EV Stock Still Flying Under the Radar Interested in Crypto?

       " 'Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel warns that stocks could drop 10% as soon as December — hold fast with these 3 ‘conservative’ tech picks\\n\\nThe stock market could suffer a 10% correction as early as December if the Federal Reserve starts cracking down on inflation, a respected author and professor of finance says.\\n\\nWith inflation hitting a 30-year high of 6.2% in October, Jeremy Siegel expects the Fed will finally roll up its sleeves at its next meeting. That could mean the end of low interest rates and the beginning of market volatility.\\n\\n“When the Fed gets serious, and I think they will at this December meeting, we’re going to see some tremors,” the Wharton School prof recently told CNBC.\\n\\nEven so, Siegel believes the stock market remains the only reliable source of inflation-topping returns, and that “conservative tech stocks” should perform well.\\n\\nHere are three stocks that could shield your portfolio from the howling winds of inflation and turn a healthy profit, especially if you’re investing for free.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\\n\\nOne of Microsoft’s greatest defenses against inflation is an enormous user base that depends on the company’s tech for both personal and business uses.\\n\\nCheck out these recent numbers: 54 million Microsoft 365 subscribers; 250 million Microsoft Teams users, 1.3 billion Windows 10 users. These tend to be highly invested customers who aren’t likely to flee to other companies in the face of modest price hikes.\\n\\nThe same can be said for Microsoft’s growing list of Azure clients. The company’s cloud technology is just too central to many businesses for them to shy away from higher prices.\\n\\n(If you’re going through a budget crunch of your own right now, remember that you can always keep up the momentum by investing with just your “spare change.”)\\n\\nThe cloud has been a game-changer for Microsoft. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, cloud sales rose by 36% year-over-year. They were a major factor in the company’s overall revenue growing by 22%.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s stock price is up a whopping 51% this year.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Andrey Bayda / Shutterstock\\n\\nMicrosoft may have a dedicated user base, but Apple benefits from customer loyalty that can border on obsession. That’s great news for inflation-era investors.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple’s customers have never balked at paying high prices for premium phones, laptops or watches, and their insatiable appetite for the company’s devices has made it the world’s biggest tech company in terms of revenue.\\n\\nA mountain of capital and a willingness to innovate should allow Apple to keep evolving and providing long-term value. The company’s plans to reimagine the iPad and get into the electric vehicle market could open significant new revenue streams.\\n\\nWhen those streams start flowing, it’ll be icing on an already sweet cake. Apple’s fourth quarter, which wrapped up in September, saw revenue shoot up 29% to $83.4 billion.\\n\\nApple’s stock has risen 21% this year.\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN) Cineberg / Shutterstock\\n\\nHow can stock in a retailer be a hedge against inflation? When that retailer is Amazon, the calculation changes a little.\\n\\nAmazon remains a go-to option for online shoppers looking to save money. The wide selection of products on offer creates competition between retailers, which keeps prices in check — and people returning to the site.\\n\\nLike Microsoft, Amazon is relying more and more on its cloud-computing division to drive profits, which makes the company a strong long-term play. In the third quarter alone, revenue generated by Amazon Web Services hit $16.1 billion, a 39% increase over Q3 2020.\\n\\nWith a single share worth more than $3,500, Amazon might not normally be your first choice as a hedge. But you can still get a piece of the company using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.\\n\\nA real alternative to the stock market Sergei Bachlakov / Shutterstock\\n\\nThe main reason Siegel is keeping his money in the stock market is because of his belief that there are no better alternatives to owning stock when inflation is raging.\\n\\n\"Even with a little bit of bumpiness in stocks, you have to be wanting to hold real assets in this scenario. And stocks are real assets,\" he says.\\n\\nBut stocks aren’t the only real assets out there; so are collectibles. And contemporary art, which has outperformed the S&P 500 almost every year since 1995, is a particularly intriguing option.\\n\\nNormally buying works by Banksy or Andy Warhol is reserved for people who are already fabulously wealthy.\\n\\nHowever, a new platform allows you to purchase shares in rapidly appreciating modern masterpieces without having to spend millions of dollars.\\n\\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Growth Stocks for 2022.\\n\\nThe optimism surrounding the global economic recovery has been dented by supply chain concerns and rising inflation. Ratings agency Moody's estimates that advanced economies will collectively grow at a rate of 4.4% in 2022, down from 5.4% in 2021, but far ahead of the 3.2% contraction registered in 2020. In August, the estimated 2022 growth rate had stood at 4.5%. Market research firm IHS Markit has also echoed these predictions but expects the global GDP growth rate next year to hover around 4.2%. Overall, most analysts see growth slowing next year.\\n\\nHowever, even as overall economic growth slows, the emerging conditions, such as easing supply pressures, slowing inflation, and improved confidence in the market due to the vaccine penetration, are likely to benefit certain sectors of the economy. A broad price correction is already underway in commodity markets. Consumer spending and industrial production are also registering robust gains, albeit with minor blips. Eurozone growth prospects are growing as well and the Chinese economy is rebounding.\\n\\nHedge funds and retail investors are loading up on growth stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). But in addition to these big names, we will take a look at some of the more affordable growth stocks with long-term growth prospects.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nThese were picked based on upcoming growth catalysts, business fundamentals, and analyst ratings. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of 867 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.  10 Best Growth Stocks for 2022\\n\\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\\n\\nBest Growth Stocks for 2022\\n\\n10. Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\\n\\nProgyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) provides fertility and family building solutions. The company has developed a solid relationship with doctors over the past few years and as delayed parenthood and egg freezing becomes more common, it looks set to benefit from increased consultancies.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBarclays analyst Sarah James recently raised the price target on Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) stock to $72 from $64 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares, noting that the adoption curve for fertility benefits pointed to increased business for the firm in 2022.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 28 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $200 million in Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY), down from 39 in the previous quarter worth $290 million.\\n\\nJust like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) is one of the stocks attracting the interest of growth investors.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Two additional names in the health care sector in the quarter, partially funded with a sale, made strong contributions and helped push our relative exposure to the sector from underweight to overweight. We also added Progyny, a leading provider of fertility benefit management services to self-insured employers. This is an increasingly important, albeit relatively underpenetrated benefit for employers, particularly those seeking to improve access and support diversity, inclusion and equity initiatives.\\n\\nProgyny realizes substantially better outcomes for patients (higher pregnancy rates, lower miscarriage rates and lower twins rates), which leads to significant cost savings for payers along with the obvious better outcomes for patients and families.\\n\\nProgyny’s mission is to improve the employee experience around fertility issues in order to aid clients in employee recruitment and retention. The company offers a rare win-win-win for employers, employees and health systems, with clear savings and quality improvements. With the company still relatively underpenetrated in its total addressable market and with logical adjacencies (labs/diagnostics, return-to-work support) and demographic tailwinds (families getting started later leads to higher infertility risk), Progyny should sustain its elevated top-line growth profile.”\\n\\n9. RAPT Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAPT)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 19\\n\\nRAPT Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAPT) is a clinical-stage biopharma company that focuses on the development of oral molecule therapies. It recently announced positive topline results from a trial of RPT193, a drug under development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.\\n\\nIn August, investment advisory SVB Leerink initiated coverage of RAPT Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAPT) stock with an Outperform rating and a price target of $49. Thomas Smith, an analyst at the advisory, issued the ratings update.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Perceptive Advisors is a leading shareholder in RAPT Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAPT) with 2.9 million shares worth more than $90 million.\\n\\n8. YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 29\\n\\nYETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI) makes and sells leisure products. The company is growing revenue and margins. The stock has rallied 34% in the past two years, outperforming the S&P 500 by 11 percentage points. As the firm embarks on an aggressive expansion strategy, analysts predict that double-digits revenue growth will continue next year.\\n\\nYETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI) recently posted earnings for the third quarter, reporting earnings per share of $0.64, beating estimates by $0.04. The revenue over the period was $362 million, up 23% year-on-year and beating estimates by $5 million.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $255 million in YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI), down from 34 in the previous quarter worth $282 million.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“We started new investment campaigns in YETI. YETI is a manufacturer of premium outdoor recreation products, including coolers and equipment, drinkware, and brand apparel and accessories. The company got its start in 2006 selling premium coolers to the hunting and fishing communities which were frustrated with equipment unable to stand up to their needs. Years later, YETI expanded into premium drinkware. These two product categories make up nearly 90% of the company’s sales today, but we see opportunities for YETI to extend its brand into additional categories over time. In addition, we believe an opportunity to increase brand awareness both domestically and internationally makes for a compelling profit cycle ahead. We used the pullback in the quarter to initiate a GardenSM position.”\\n\\n7. Inari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\\n\\nInari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) is a medical device company based in California. In late October, the company announced positive results from a trial of 500 patients treated with FlowTriever, a device for the treatment of artery blockage.\\n\\nInari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) recently smashed market expectations on earnings per share and revenue by $0.01 and $9.8 million respectively. The company has a market cap of $4 billion and was founded in 2011.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Darsana Capital Partners is a leading shareholder in Inari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) with 1.4 million shares worth more than $115 million.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Inari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Inari Medical, Inc. offers catheter-based devices to remove clots from venous thromboembolism (“VTE”), the third most common vascular condition in the U.S. after heart attacks and strokes, and which can be fatal if left untreated. Shares declined during the quarter as high-growth companies with high valuations sold off. We maintain conviction, as the VTE treatment space is still in the very early days of converting to device-based interventions, and we believe Inari is well positioned to benefit.”\\n\\n6. Trex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\\n\\nTrex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX) operates in the building products industry. There are many names in the building industry that are poised to do well as housing demand rebounds next year but Trex is best positioned to benefit from the boom given the high use of recycled content.\\n\\nStephens analyst Trey Grooms recently upgraded Trex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX) stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and raised the price target to $120 from $111, noting that the long-term demand for the company remained strong heading into the new year.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Montanaro Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Trex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX) with 493,000 shares worth more than $50 million.\\n\\nIn addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Trex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX) is one of the stocks on the radar of hedge funds.\\n\\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Trex Company, Inc. (NYSE:TREX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Just as the new home market has been hopping amid low interest rates and the greater need for space, the market for home improvement has also been robust for similar reasons. Decks have been perfect places for safe social gatherings during the pandemic, and ClearBridge portfolio holding Trex has been meeting demand with its composite decking made from recycled wood fibers and plastic waste.\\n\\nTrex’s high-performance decking portfolio is made using more than 95% recycled content. Trex uses locally sourced reclaimed wood that would otherwise end up in landfills and so avoids cutting down trees to make its products. The recycled plastic film it uses comes from a variety of sources, including industrial shrink wrap, agricultural plastic sheeting and household plastic such as grocery and shopping bags. With the average 500-square foot composite Trex deck containing 140,000 recycled plastic bags, Trex is one of the largest plastic bag recyclers in the U.S. The company has also innovated ways of recycling dirtier plastics more likely to end up in landfills.\\n\\nTrex has seen already strong demand get stronger during the pandemic; the company was sold out during much of 2020 and began expanding capacity across the U.S. to meet heightened demand. With lumber prices soaring amid the strong housing market, Trex’s composite decks are increasingly gaining share, especially in price-sensitive areas of the market, which bodes well for both the environment and shareholders.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks for 2022.\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n15 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now 10 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now 10 Best SPACs to Invest In According to Reddit\\n\\nDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), among others discussed in detail below.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nThese were picked based on business fundamentals and analyst ratings. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of 867 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\\n\\nOnline Education Stocks to Buy\\n\\n10. Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\\n\\nChegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) owns and runs a learning platform. Dan Rosensweig, the CEO of the company, recently acknowledged that the company had registered a minor blip in performance due to “short-term industry conditions rather than anything company specific”.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber has a Market Perform rating on Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) stock with a price target of $49. In an investor note, the analyst appreciated the earnings beat of the firm in the third quarter but lamented lowered guidance numbers.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Polar Capital is a leading shareholder in Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) with 999,122 shares worth more than $67 million.\\n\\nJust like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are buying.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, Alger, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Chegg, Inc. was among the top detractors from performance. Chegg provides online textbook rentals and other internet delivered services, such as homework help, tutoring and assistance with obtaining scholarships and finding internships. The company has been acquiring customers at low cost, in part because it is a leader in providing supplementary educational services to college students. Its Chegg Services offering helps students master subjects, get better grades, graduate and pursue careers. After posting a very strong 2020, the stock has experienced a general pullback based on the market perception that Chegg was simply a “Covid-19 beneficiary” and now with a reopening economy will experience weakness. We believe, however, that the company’s recent inroads to previously untapped international markets and new controls on shared password/account access are positive developments for Chegg.”\\n\\n9. Stride, Inc. (NYSE:LRN)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\\n\\nStride, Inc. (NYSE:LRN) is a technology-based education services firm. The stock has soared in the past few months as the company reports impressive increase in enrollments, driven by the surging interest in the Career Learning segment.\\n\\nIn September, Citi analyst Thomas Singlehurst initiated coverage of Stride, Inc. (NYSE:LRN) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $65, underlining the firm as a “compelling play” for investors in the online education industry.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 21 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $145 million in Stride, Inc. (NYSE:LRN), the same as in the previous quarter worth $106 million.\\n\\nIn its Q4 2020 investor letter, Wasatch Micro Cap Value Fund highlighted a few stocks and Stride, Inc. (NYSE:LRN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“The largest detractor from Fund performance for the fourth quarter was Stride, Inc. (LRN), formerly known as K12, Inc. This technology-based education company offers proprietary curriculum, software and services created for online delivery to students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The stock declined despite reasonably strong enrollment. In hindsight, we underestimated investor concerns that there’ll be considerably lower demand for the company’s services as the economy reopens more fully. Nevertheless, we believe those concerns may be overblown and it’s possible the pandemic has changed parents’ and students’ mindsets toward online education. Therefore, we think annual growth—even after the pandemic ends—could be at double-digit rates. This is because the industry itself and Stride’s market share both have plenty of room to expand. Moreover, any reluctance to give Stride a try could be reduced because the company’s fees are paid by schools, not by parents. And Stride is expanding by also offering at-home services that are integrated with school-based education.”\\n\\n8. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\\n\\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) owns and runs a video-first communications platform. Kelly Steckelberg, the CFO of the firm, recently said that Zoom was focused on the launch of new products rather than the “stock price”, an apparent reference to the year-to-date decrease in Zoom stock price as the economy normalizes and offices reopen.\\n\\nWells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin has an Equal Weight rating on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) stock with a price target of $245. In a recent investor note, the analyst forecast that the firm will continue to grow in the coming months at a slower rate.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Tiger Global Management LLC is a leading shareholder in Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) with 4.7 million shares worth more than $1.2 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“We concluded our campaigns in Zoom Video Communications. We have been paring our position in Zoom for several quarters, anticipating the reduced need for video conferencing as vaccination rates climb and people return to their workplaces. That said, we believe there is a strong case to be made that the pandemic has prompted a permanent inflection in videoconferencing’s importance—sustainably higher remote work arrangements, more online learning and less business travel. Furthermore, the company’s dramatically expanded user base (up 485% YoY in Q3) positions it well to cross sell additional services, Zoom Phone in particular. The long-term future remains bright, but we decided to end our successful investment campaign in favor of opportunities in our pipeline with more attractive near-term growth prospects.”\\n\\n7. RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\\n\\nRingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) provides software-as-a-service solutions. The company recently announced that it would be paying $650 million to Mitel, a communications firm, in a strategic deal to purchase patents covering network management, security, and infrastructure.\\n\\nNeedham analyst Ryan Koontz recently maintained a Buy rating on RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) stock and raised the price target to $400 from $360, appreciating the stellar third quarter earnings report of the company.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC  is a leading shareholder in RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) with 3.9 million shares worth more than $859 million.\\n\\nHere is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“RingCentral, Inc. has been a three-year portfolio holding and remains a leader in the cloud unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) space, which includes voice, video, messaging, and call center services. But after posting its third quarter in a row of accelerating revenue growth in the first quarter, RingCentral’s shares began to sell off on fears around heightened competition with both Microsoft Teams, of which RingCentral is a partner, and with Zoom Communications, a former partner who has launched its own voice communications offering. Shares sold off further during the period with the rotation out of secular growth names into cyclicals. We used the pullback in the shares to add significantly to our position given RingCentral’s best-in-class UCaaS technology, including five 9’s contractual service commitments (fully operational 99.999% of the time) for voice, which is orders of magnitude above its competitors; presence in roughly 40 countries; data governance and security requirements; number portability with all the relevant domestic and international carriers; and positioning as the Gartner Magic Quadrant UCaaS Leader. The UCaaS market is still quite early in its adoption curve, with only about 3% penetration of the roughly 400 million existing business landline seats in operation today. We believe RingCentral is in a solid position to capture meaningful share of this market, with its exclusive partnerships with legacy landline players like Avaya, Atos, and Alcatel, which effectively gives it a “hunting license” for about half of those 400 million legacy seats, leveraging joint go-to-market efforts with each partner. We remain confident that RingCentral is well positioned to achieve at least 30% top-line growth for years to come, along with steadily improving operating margins and free cash flow generation.”\\n\\n6. Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\\n\\nCoursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) operates an online educational content platform. The company crossed the $100 million in quarterly revenue mark earlier this year, boosting the share price by as much as 17%.\\n\\nIn August, investment advisory Raymond James upgraded Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) stock to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $45. Brain Peterson, an analyst at the advisory, issued the ratings update.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2021, 25 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $173 million in Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR), up from 11 in the previous quarter worth $52 million.\\n\\nIn addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) is one of the stocks attracting the attention of elite investors.\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Online Education Stocks to Buy.\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n10 Notable Earnings Reports You Don’t Want to Miss Mario Gabelli is Dumping These 15 Stocks 15 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in the World\\n\\nDisclosure.

       " \"Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently became a hot topic after CEO Satya Nadella sold more than half of his shares for about $285 million on Nov. 22 and 23. When Nadella took over as Microsoft's third CEO in 2014, the tech giant was in serious trouble. Microsoft's cloud business became its core growth engine, and the company's revenue surged from $86.8 billion in fiscal 2014 to $168.1 billion in fiscal 2021, which ended this June, as its earnings per share more than tripled.\",\n",
       " \"One of the most remarkable developments that sprouted during the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic was how quickly longstanding paradigms changed. Prior to the global health crisis, financial analysts warned young people that they weren’t investing in equities. However, the popularity of Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) led to the phenomenon of so-called Robinhood stocks to buy.\\n\\nIt turns out, young people were not much different from older generations. Millennials and Generation Z cared plenty about wealth generation. Apparently, they just needed a little gamification to inspire them. Of course, Robinhood is a master of emotional encouragement (some might call it manipulation), stroking egos and transaction orders. However, the arguments underlying Robinhood stocks aren’t as crazy as you might initially believe.\\n\\nIndeed, the top 50 opportunities listed on the StonksNews website feature a wide variety of ideas. Yes, you do have your speculative plays like Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL). At time of writing, SNDL was at the top of the order. However, among these popular Robinhood stocks, you have companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which this crowd might consider geriatric. Nevertheless, it features highly, suggesting a method to the madness.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nHonestly, you might want to reconsider how you label those who follow social media guidance regarding Robinhood stocks to buy. A vast majority of these ideas I can see myself supporting irrespective of market circumstances. For instance, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which is listed at No. 48, is an excellent consumer staples idea that’s appropriate for almost any investor.\\n\\n7 Stocks to Buy to Build Your Own 'Elon Musk' Portfolio\\n\\nWith the final month of the year coming up, many investors will undoubtedly look to reposition their portfolio for 2022 and beyond. In that vein, here are my thoughts on the best Robinhood stocks to buy for December.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFord (NYSE:F) Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) AMC (NYSE:AMC) Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) Uber (NYSE:UBER) Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\\n\\nWhile I believe that followers of popular Robinhood stocks deserve more credit than they usually receive from mainstream media coverage, it’s also important to independently perform your due diligence. Before making your final decision on any stock, make sure it fits with your strategy and risk-reward profile.\\n\\nRobinhood Stocks: Ford (F) Ford (F Stock) logo on a steering wheel.\\n\\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTypically, I don’t like to put publicly traded securities that I own top of any lists of opportunities to consider. However, with American automaker Ford, I’ll make an exception. The social media crowd love the company, making it one of the most popular Robinhood stocks to buy. And I’m particularly proud of this idea because I asked readers to assess it and I put my money where my mouth is.\\n\\nBelieve me, that’s saying a lot because personally, I’m not a big fan of American cars. However, when I saw that Ford was developing the Mustang Mach-E, an electric vehicle crossover, I had a strong feeling that F stock was going to be a winner. So far, I’ve been proven correct, with Ford posting a year-to-date performance of almost 128% heading into the final weekend before Thanksgiving.\\n\\nPrimarily, the Mach-E provides a much-needed alternative to the EVs that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been pumping out. No offense to any TSLA fans but the company’s vehicles tend to look the same. Certainly, automotive consumers — especially of more premium vehicles — want to stand out and Ford gives them that opportunity.\\n\\nThat F also happens to attract a big crowd among fans of Robinhood stocks is icing on the cake.\\n\\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\\n\\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAlthough an always relevant name among Robinhood stocks, Walmart is a tricky one at this juncture. As the king of big-box retailers, I think you have to respect WMT, no matter what circumstance it finds itself in. Further, Walmart benefits from fortuitous timing. As I mentioned in my interview with CGTN America, the yearlong lockdown and social mitigation measures have given American consumers cabin fever.\\n\\nAnd we’re not unique in this regard. Plenty of people are sick and tired of the pandemic and associated mandates, such as social distancing. Therefore, people are ready to go out and reclaim their normal lives, which includes mundane things like shopping at Walmart.\\n\\nBut like I said, WMT is one of the toughest Robinhood stocks to navigate because so much retail originates from China. Here’s a source that estimates 70% to 80% of Walmart’s merchandise come from Chinese suppliers. Further, President Biden is apparently considering a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics. That’s going to be problematic, considering that he made some headway with his recent virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\n\\n7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Ride the Rally in Commodities\\n\\nStill, the bottom line may be that American consumers are sitting on $2.7 trillion in crisis savings. That’s a huge plus for WMT.\\n\\nRobinhood Stocks: Meta Platforms (FB) Meta logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\\n\\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAnother interesting idea among Robinhood stocks to buy is Meta Platforms. Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms rebranded itself in late October of this year to reflect CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s long-term ambitions. According to The Verge, the “rebrand is about solidifying the social media giant as being about the metaverse, which Zuckerberg sees as the future of the internet.”\\n\\nNow, many folks debate what the metaverse means. The Verge describes it as “an expansive, immersive vision of the internet taken from the pages of sci-fi novels like Snow Crash and Ready Player One.” For those that haven’t seen these films, imagine the internet as a global community connected through information. But note that this information requires a device-based intermediary: a computer or mobile device.\\n\\nBasically, the metaverse is the next step in the internet revolution where you become your own intermediary. Of course, we’re not quite there yet but through platforms like virtual and augmented reality, the user can get closer and closer to becoming personally integrated with the internet.\\n\\nHonestly, I find the concept a little kooky but so many are eating this stuff up. Therefore, FB is worth a look.\\n\\nAMC (AMC) People wearing masks walking past an AMC theater.\\n\\nSource: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOne of the original meme trades that catapulted the concept of Robinhood stocks to the forefront, AMC Entertainment is perhaps the very definition of fortuitous, as the company was struggling since the middle of the last decade and that’s no longer the case.\\n\\nWith streaming platforms dominating, along with plentiful at-home entertainment options like video games, the box office was losing ground with young adult audiences. Then, the coronavirus struck and you’d be forgiven to think it was lights out for the company. Due to government restrictions on non-essential activities, there was nothing that management could do except hope for the best.\\n\\nWell, there was another approach: pray to the meme gods. Out of nowhere, AMC stock skyrocketed from the early 2021 doldrums, in no small part to meme traders who wanted revenge against bearish hedge funds — the same hedge funds that they perceived as destroying their parents’ lives during the Great Recession.\\n\\n7 Alternative Cryptos to Watch as Bitcoin Tests the $55,000 Level\\n\\nAnother intriguing tidbit: since early August, AMC has generally charted a series of higher lows. Now, if the meme traders can convince management to pay their general managers, that’d be something!\\n\\nRobinhood Stocks: Plug Power (PLUG) Image of a man driving a forklift in a warehouse.\\n\\nSource: Halfpoint/ShutterStock.com\\n\\nA company with a relatively long history, most of the narrative behind Plug Power has been one of aspirations denied. Back during the crazy dot-com bubble, PLUG stock briefly commanded a share price in four-digit territory. But obviously, that lofty status evaporated, with the underlying company struggling to forward its hydrogen fuel-cell technology.\\n\\nThen, during the midst of the great investment shift — brought largely by the wave of worker bees operating remotely along with those ever helpful stimulus checks — PLUG became one of the heavily hyped Robinhood stocks. By late January of this year, shares closed up above $70, a multi-decade record. Still, like prior plug rallies, this one eventually faded.\\n\\nNot to put readers through another rollercoaster ride but PLUG again ranks among the most popular Robinhood stocks. Per a Barron’s report, “Plug Power, which makes hydrogen fuel cell powered fork lifts, plans to make hydrogen-powered heavy-duty trucks while manufacturing and distributing the hydrogen gas required for its transportation products.”\\n\\nPersonally, I’m leery of these emotionally driven speculative names but PLUG might be good for a sizable December pop for short-term traders.\\n\\nUber (UBER) The Uber (UBER) logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background.\\n\\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOn StonksNews’ top 50 list of Robinhood stocks to buy, ride-sharing giant Uber was the caboose at time of writing. Therefore, it’s quite possible that by the time you read this, it could have dropped out of the top 50. Nevertheless, even if it experiences a bout of volatility, it might not fall that far.\\n\\nPrimarily, bullish investors can take heart that ride sharing has become a much more ingrained practice in American society. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center report, ride-sharing services were mostly popular among young people, as you would expect. However, the 50-years-plus demographic experienced the greatest percentage growth in terms of survey respondents who hailed a ride-sharing service at least once.\\n\\nLogically, the narrative took a hit because of the coronavirus pandemic. But as we have become acclimated to the crisis, UBER might make a comeback. It’s risky but since the spring doldrums of 2020, shares have printed a series of higher lows. This suggests, though it’s not guaranteed, that UBER could swing higher.\\n\\n7 Hot Penny Stocks to Buy for December That Are Positioned to Pop\\n\\nAs well, the company’s Uber Eats division could enjoy more demand, especially as consumers are sitting on that aforementioned $2.7 trillion worth of pandemic savings.\\n\\nRobinhood Stocks: Peloton (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nArguably one of the riskiest Robinhood stocks available, I was surprised to see Peloton ranked so highly on StonksNews’ list at No. 8. As you know, Peloton was one of the top pandemic winners as its home fitness bike fit perfectly into the quarantine lifestyle.\\n\\nIndeed, you could have made a case that Peloton was a healthcare-related investment. According to Harvard Health Publishing, “39% of patients gained weight during the pandemic, with weight gain defined as above the normal fluctuation of 2.5 pounds. Approximately 27% gained less than 12.5 pounds and about 10% gained more than 12.5 pounds, with 2% gaining over 27.5 pounds.”\\n\\nFor those that didn’t gain weight — or better yet, lost it — they might have burned away the calories on their Peloton bikes.\\n\\nHowever, as the New York Times pointed out, shares of pandemic darlings have tumbled as the health threat faded. With people largely resuming their normal activities, does PTON have a future?\\n\\nAccording to Peloton CEO John Foley, the company’s belief that fitness will move to the home remains unchanged. He might be onto something, considering that the work-from-home initiative might not be permanent. If so, people will look to other means to recapture time, including canceling their gym membership in favor of home fitness.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in F and AMC.

Och's OZ Management Portfolio: Top Stock Picks\\n\\n10. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT)\\n\\nOZ Management’s Stake Value: $236,391,000\\n\\nPercentage of OZ Management’s 13F Portfolio: 1.94%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 44\\n\\nHilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), a multinational American hospitality corporation, is recognized for its rich portfolio of assets including hotel establishments and resorts. Among its 18 signature hotel brands, the most well known are Hilton Grand Vacations, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, and Hampton by Hilton, among others.\\n\\nOZ Management holds a $236.3 million stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), which represents 1.94% of the fund's Q3 portfolio. The leading stakeholder in the company is Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, with 12.88 million shares valued at $1.7 billion. Overall, 44 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) as of September, with a total stake value of $5.36 billion.\\n\\nHilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), on October 27, posted its Q3 earnings. EPS in the period totaled $0.78, missing estimates by -$0.06. The $1.75 billion revenue was up 87.46% from the prior-year quarter, beating estimated revenue by $56.41 million.\\n\\nOn October 28, BMO Capital analyst Ari Klein raised the price target on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) to $144 from $135 but kept a Market Perform rating on the stock following the Q3 results. The analyst was also positive that demand for the hospitality industry would grow, and occupancy rates would be better as a result.\\n\\nIn addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a notable stock in Daniel Och’s Q3 portfolio.\\n\\nHere is what Pershing Square Holdings has to say about Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“While the hotel industry has been extremely negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hilton has done an excellent job navigating industry volatility, a testament to the company’s high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model and superb management team. From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows and investment returns once the business recovers to pre-COVID-19 demand levels.\\n\\nIndustry RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) bottomed in April 2020 and has shown sequential improvement every quarter as travel and mobility have recovered along with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and a resumption in travel. In recent months, there is increasing evidence that a robust recovery scenario is underway, led by domestic leisure travel occasions which are currently trending above 2019 demand levels. For the first three weeks of July, the most recent data the company provided, RevPAR has already recovered to 85% of 2019 levels – a significant improvement over prior months driven by increased hotel occupancy and a rapid recovery in rate.\\n\\nWhile management anticipates a moderation in leisure demand as we exit the summer, it expects the moderation in leisure travel to be offset by a more pronounced recovery in business transient travel occasions as offices reopen this fall. Although there remains near-term uncertainty in domestic travel given the increase in COVID-19 case numbers following the arrival of the Delta variant in the U.S., we believe that the medium-term outlook continues to point to a robust recovery scenario. Throughout the pandemic, Hilton took actions to reduce corporate expenses by about 20% compared to 2019 levels.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the company provided resources and support to the Hilton owner community which further solidified Hilton as the preferred franchise partner, thereby expanding Hilton’s pipeline of units around the world.\\n\\nIn the most recent quarter Hilton affirmed its near-to-medium term outlook of mid-single-digit net unit growth, and a resumption of its historical 6-7% net unit growth beginning in 2023-2024, higher growth than competitors, and further evidence of Hilton’s unique business model.\\n\\nWe believe that Hilton will continue to grow its market share over time given independent hotels’ increased interest in seeking an affiliation with global brands, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. While the recovery may continue to be uneven, Hilton has made tremendous progress which will help it become an even more profitable and stronger business going forward.”\\n\\n9. Anaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN)\\n\\nOZ Management’s Stake Value: $245,581,000\\n\\nPercentage of OZ Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.02%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\\n\\nAnaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN), an on-demand business planning software company, is one of the top stock picks of OZ Management as of September 2021. OZ Management owns over 4 million shares in the company, worth $245.5 million. Anaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN) represents 2.02% of OZ Management’s Q3 investments.\\n\\nAnaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN) posted its Q3 results on November 23, with EPS for the quarter being -$0.05, beating estimates by $0.06. The company’s revenue amounted to $155.35 million, up 35.23% year-over-year.\\n\\nAs of Q3 2021, 61 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 867 elite funds were bullish on Anaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN), and reported owning stakes in the company worth $2.8 billion. This is an increase as compared to the prior quarter, with 52 funds holding a position in Anaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN), with a total stake value of $2.1 billion. The leading stakeholder of Anaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN) is Eric Bannasch’s Cadian Capital, with 5.3 million shares worth $323.7 million.\\n\\nHere is what Alger Mid Cap Focus Fund has to say about Anaplan, Inc. (NYSE:PLAN) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Anaplan, Inc. was among the top detractors from performance. Anaplan is a leading provider of cloud-based business planning software. Anaplan’s software platform aims to solve the most complex planning needs of large global enterprises across various business lines. Unlike traditional business planning software, which is often rigid, siloed and opaque, Anaplan’s platform is designed to enable broader enterprise participation and better workforce collaboration during the business planning process. Through better planning, large enterprises can more effectively allocate resources to cut costs and generate revenue. Today Anaplan has over 1,600 customers across a variety of end markets and business use cases.\\n\\nAnaplan shares underperformed in the first quarter as part of a broader sector rotation as high-growth software stocks fell out of favor relative to more cyclically exposed investment opportunities. We believe Anaplan’s focus on growth over near-term profit generation negatively impacts the company’s stock in a rising interest rate environment.\\n\\nFundamentally, Anaplan had strong fourth quarter earnings result, with the company seeing an acceleration of billings growth and a strong demand pipeline as companies realize the need for a more flexible digital planning solution.”\\n\\n8. The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT)\\n\\nOZ Management’s Stake Value: $273,267,000\\n\\nPercentage of OZ Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.25%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 45\\n\\nThe New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) is an American media corporation known for publishing the New York Times newspaper. On November 2, Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Yeh raised the price target on The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) to $65 from $60 and kept an Overweight rating on the stock. OZ Management, as of Q3 2021, holds over 5.5 million shares in the company, worth $273.2 million, representing 2.25% of the fund's total investments.\\n\\nAt the end of September, 45 hedge funds were long The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT), with a total stake value of $2.43 billion, as reported by the database of Insider Monkey. The leading The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) stakeholder is Anand Desai’s Darsana Capital Partners, with a $418.7 million position in the company.\\n\\nThe New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) posted its Q3 results on November 3. EPS in the period equaled $0.23, beating estimates by $0.02. The $509.1 million revenue was up 19.26% from the previous-year quarter, exceeding estimated revenue by $9.79 million.\\n\\nHere is what Greenhaven Road Capital has to say about The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:\\n\\n“The second significant investment that we made during the quarter was in The New York Times (NYT). The newspaper business is very challenged; in fact, industry wide revenues are hovering somewhere around the 1980s’ level and circulation sits at multi-decade lows. The NYT’s revenue rose by 14% from 2015 to 2019 (last full years available). No, that is not 14% per year, but rather 14% total over those five years. For many years, digital advertising was to be the savior of media companies, but this has not proven to be the hoped-for panacea as Google and Facebook have taken content from publishers under very depressed economics and digital ad rates have declined. The New York Times’ print subscriptions are down more than 50% from their peak and will likely trend to zero in the next decade.\\n\\nWhile the top line quantitative data is underwhelming, the business is transitioning away from an advertising-supported to a subscription-supported model. In 2000, The New York Times’ revenue was made up of approximately 25% subscription and 75% advertising/other. Today those numbers are flipped, with approximately 75% of revenue earned from subscriptions.\\n\\nThe transition to a subscription-based business has been a gradual one for which The New York Times was ill-prepared. In 2011, the Times instituted a paywall to limit individuals’ monthly readership in order to drive heavy online consumers to begin to pay for continued access. In the decade since, they have gone through an iterative process of enhancing the marketing team, improving the technology, and experimenting with pricing tiers, products, and offerings. A subscription focused business requires different skills than an ad-supported organization. The latter is focused primarily on traffic, while the former is much more focused on customer acquisition costs, retention rates, and lifetime value of subscribers.\\n\\nSubscribers are grouped into cohorts and segmented by areas of interest, frequency of consumption, type of content consumed, and breadth of content consumed. Over time, the tracking and marketing has gotten more sophisticated – figuring out better ways to nudge registered users to become subscribers and getting existing subscribers to renew. A registered user who only reads political articles may be sent targeted emails highlighting other types of content since people who come to the site for two or more content areas subscribe at much higher rates. Other tactics include varying introductory pricing by user type and adjusting renewal rates based on each individual user’s data profile. These changes have required the Times to improve technology and personnel at all levels of the company, including the board of directors, which is surprisingly tech savvy.\\n\\nThe New York Times actually gets better as it gets larger. There is a flywheel in effect: quality content drives subscriptions, which provide more resources for better content, which drives additional subscribers, which provides again more resources for content. The New York Times pays starting reporters two to three times the industry average, and, given they have four times the number of subscribers as their next-largest peer, they can hire the best talent. Recently, they have hired notable journalists Ezra Klein, Ben Smith, and Kara Swisher from small upstart competitors. The strong have gotten stronger. With their scale, they can provide more and better coverage on international events and other special topics, helping to attract more subscribers. Scale also allows them to devote quality resources to complicated, drawn-out research on issues such as Donald Trump’s taxes, and fosters access to “exclusive” stories because they can provide reach, which drives subscribers, which provides resources.\\n\\nThe New York Times has also benefited from consumers’ increasing willingness to pay for content. While hidden under the decline in print revenues and digital ad revenues, The New York Times has built the world’s largest subscription news business with 25%+ growth per year over the past five years. Their financials are starting to reach an inflection point where the growth in digital subscribers is larger than the print and digital ad declines, allowing the profitability of the subscription model to become more evident as fixed costs are spread across a larger customer base with effectively zero incremental costs for distribution. As a result, The New York Times should be able to continue building their news organization and still benefit from operating leverage as their revenue should grow far faster than their fixed costs from this point forward.\\n\\nThe future for the Times is interesting, in part, because the competitive landscape is so challenged. Humans have a natural desire to know and understand what is going on in the world. To push the fight club metaphor to its breaking point, in 2000 The New York Times was a ...

Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\\n\\nOZ Management’s Stake Value: $288,696,000\\n\\nPercentage of OZ Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.38%\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 146\\n\\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), a multinational financial services corporation offering credit cards and payment systems, posted its Q3 results on October 28. EPS in the period came in at $2.37, beating estimates by $0.18. The $4.99 billion revenue reflected a 29.92% increase from the prior-year quarter, exceeding estimated revenue by $35.79 million.\\n\\nOZ Management holds a $288.6 million stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) as of the third quarter, which accounts for 2.38% of the fund's total 13F securities. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the leading Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stakeholder, holding a position worth over $2 billion in the company. Overall, 146 hedge funds tracked by the Q3 database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), valued at $17.65 billion.\\n\\nUBS analyst Rayna Kumar on November 17 assumed coverage of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) with a Buy rating and a $448 price target, stating that the company has significant growth opportunities in Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa.\\n\\nHere is what L1 Capital has to say about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Mastercard returned to the top 10. We have held Mastercard since the inception of the Fund. Over the 6 weeks to 30 September 2021, Mastercard’s share price retreated 10% and we took advantage of what we believe will be a short-term pullback in the share price to add to our investment. Recent weakness in Mastercard’s share price is most likely due to concerns about disintermediation and other pressures caused by growth in ‘Buy now, Pay later’ and other new payment offerings, as well a general market rotation away from higher growth companies in favour of more cyclical businesses.”\\n\\n6. salesforce.com, inc.

In fact, you’ll often find the underdog’s legacy product On Device Media preinstalled on phones — think of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T) sponsored ads that pop up every now and then.\\n\\nFortunately, Digital Turbine didn’t stop at pop-up ads, going on an acquisition spree to create a vertically integrated digital ad agency. Today, Digital Turbine covers every aspect from programmatic ad trading to advertising platforms.\\n\\nAs companies begin to shift their attention to the Metaverse, Digital Turbine looks set to become a dark-horse winner once again. Google has long struggled to migrate its web-dependent advertising platform to mobile and another stumble into the Metaverse will see its mobile-native rival leap ahead.\\n\\nNot everything, however, has been smooth sailing for Digital Turbine. The upstart has seen significant merger-related challenges across its nine separate offices. And its organic growth rates, which topped 82.6% this quarter, are expected to slow to 35% by 2024, according to Wall Street analysts.\\n\\nYet this mobile-native advertiser has emerged as a surprising value play in the AdTech space, especially compared to its peers. Its 4.5x forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio makes it far cheaper than Google or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and a $5.4 billion valuation means it still has plenty of room to run.\\n\\nHigh-Potential Play: Matterport (MTTR)\\n\\nI’ve written about Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) before — a company that creates the “dollhouses” you see on virtual home tours.\\n\\nMatterport now has another secret weapon that could help it succeed in the Metaverse:\\n\\nIts vast repository of data.\\n\\nFor years, MTTR has been working with museums and stores to collect all manner of real-world imagery in 3D. You can now visit the Abu Simble Temple in Egypt and the PUBLIC Art Gallery in the U.K. from the comfort of your home. Those inclined to retail therapy can also visit virtual stores like Lloyds Antiques Aoyama to buy real-world furniture. A screenshot showing a virtual location in Matterport.\\n\\n“Welcome to our store. How can we help?”\\n\\nIf our universe is going digital, Matterport will be there to help.\\n\\nMTTR’s greater upside, however, comes with significant valuation risks. This $6.6 billion company generated just $27 million in revenue last quarter, making it one of the most expensive stocks in the Moonshot universe. And Matterport’s declining gross profit margins suggest the startup is already sacrificing margins for the sake of growth.\\n\\nBut with 6.2 million spaces already under management, Matterport is already well on its way to digitizing our physical world.\\n\\nMeme Stock Potential: Immersion (IMMR)\\n\\nVuxiz (NASDAQ:VUZI)… Glimpse Group (NASDAQ:VRAR)… MultiMetaVerse (NASDAQ:MPAC)… there’s no shortage of microcap Metaverse companies that could be the next meme stock.\\n\\nBut if I had to choose one low-quality stock to buy, it would be Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR).\\n\\nIn many ways, Immersion looks a lot like its money-losing peers: a history of losses, low employee morale and technology that seems too far ahead of its time.\\n\\nBut if companies like Facebook are seriously considering a move into virtual reality, IMMR could become what Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) was to Apple’s iPhone.\\n\\nImmersion is a patent licensing company focused on haptic technology, or touch-based feedback mechanisms. Its intellectual property (IP) can already be found in PlayStation 5 controllers by Sony (NYSE:SONY) and some Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) smartphones. Electric vehicles — especially those with large touchscreens — also utilize the technology.\\n\\nIn a sense, haptic technology has been the missing link for realistic virtual reality (run-in-place treadmills are another, for the more physically inclined). Without touch feedback, virtual worlds seem just that. Virtual. But as hardware manufacturers race to create better hardware kits, they’ll need firms like IMMR to deliver the goods.\\n\\nIMMR currently trades at a $190 million valuation, down two-thirds since February. With such a cheap valuation, it’s a Moonshot that could be worth the risk. An illustration of two viruses chasing the Earth.\\n\\nSource: Catalyst Labs / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nValuation Catches Up With the Healthcare Metaverse\\n\\nMetaverse investing has also seen its share of bumps. Over the past week, every Top 10 company in the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF underperformed the S&P 500.\\n\\nOne Metaverse sector, however, will take home the “wooden spoon” prize for worst performance.\\n\\nTelehealth.\\n\\nSince January, shares in web-enabled healthcare firms Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) and TalkSpace (NASDAQ:TALK) have declined 50% and 77%, respectively. HIMS, IRTC, SLHG and a whole host of others have seen similar drops.\\n\\nAt first glance, investors might blame the post-pandemic economy. A return to in-person doctor visits would surely reduce the need for offsite medical services, no?\\n\\nA deeper look, however, shows that valuations were the more likely culprit. Teladoc’s price-to-sales ratio peaked at 50x in February — lofty even for a company expected to grow 80% next year. TalkSpace’s CEO resigned this month after failing to hit lofty targets (23% topline growth apparently couldn’t please the board).\\n\\nThese two companies will eventually rebound; rising healthcare prices will continue to push providers to more cost-effective solutions. But when investing in Metaverse stocks, it helps to keep expectations in line.\\n\\nCan GameStop Succeed In the Metaverse?\\n\\nIn February, I wrote how the incoming GameStop (NYSE:GME) CEO Ryan Cohen needed help to send GME back to $500. With only 13% of GME’s voting shares, the activist investor would need the help of retail investors to secure the board chairmanship.\\n\\nNow that Reddit has helped Mr. Cohen accomplish that task, what’s next?\\n\\nMany on Wall Street have speculated that the 36-year-old entrepreneur would reuse his Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) playbook. Mr. Cohen himself suggested that e-commerce fulfillment could become a major part of GameStop’s business.\\n\\nBut Chewy’s founder has a habit of surprising Wall Street. In October, the firm quietly removed its Chief Operating Officer, a recent hire from Amazon’s multi-channel fulfillment department. In her place, a dozen crypto and NFT-related job postings cropped up on the GameStop careers page.\\n\\nIt wouldn’t be the first time GameStop has attempted online gaming. In 2010, the firm bought Kongregate, a San Francisco-based company creating browser-based games. And in 2011, the firm followed up with two acquisitions that would allow users to run games in the cloud.\\n\\nThese early acquisitions ended in failure — the Texas-based retailer seemed ill-equipped to make the jump online.\\n\\nBut this go around, GameStop seems to have a newfound purpose. Perhaps this time might be different after all.\\n\\nP.S. Do you want to hear more about cryptocurrencies? Penny stocks? Options?

       " 'Launched in 2008, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) provides data-driven, client-to-cloud networking services for large data centers, as well as campus and routing environments. The company went public in June 2014, and you may have heard about the recent, huge decline of ANET stock. Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThere’s no need to worry; the tumble was not caused by investors dumping their shares. Rather, it was triggered by a split of the stock. That development could actually make Arista more enticing to investors and traders.\\n\\nWe’ll certainly delve into the details of the stock split, but there’s a bigger story to be told here. Specifically, Arista Networks has been generating strong revenue growth – and there’s fresh data to prove this point.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nNot only that, but the company was just inducted into an elite association of security-software vendors. That represents another big win for Arista, and by extension, for the company’s shareholders.\\n\\nA Closer Look at ANET Stock\\n\\nIn 2021 so far, Arista’s loyal investors have enjoyed steady gains. The stock started the year at $70, but was already threatening to break above $100 by the summer.\\n\\nThen a swift run-up occurred in early November as ANET stock jumped to $130. Now value-focused investors might wonder whether the stock is too expensive. So let’s check a commonly used valuation metric.\\n\\nCurrently, Arista Networks’ trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio is 51.88. That’s not the highest P/E ratio in the world, but it’s somewhat elevated. Still, a high P/E ratio can be justified when a company is rapidly growing its revenues, and I’ll definitely investigate this matter.\\n\\n7 Travel Stocks to Pack in Your Portfolio Ahead of Holiday Trips\\n\\nOne more important note about ANET stock: the company recently enacted a one-for-four share split. How does this make the stock more alluring to prospective shareholders?\\n\\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Shrey Dua explains, “In the short term, Arista is more appetizing to investors. At just one quarter” of its previous price, “Arista can once again entice new investors to the stock.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOvercoming a Challenging Environment\\n\\nAgain, even a somewhat lofty P/E ratio can be fine when a company is posting strong revenue growth. Fortunately, that appears to be the case with Arista Networks.\\n\\nNot long ago, the company released its third-quarter 2021 financial results. As it turns out, Arista’s revenues totaled $748.7 million, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter increase of 5.8%.\\n\\nEven better, its top line soared 23.7% YOY. We should also observe that Arista Networks reported GAAP net income of $224.3 million during Q3.\\n\\nThat’s a considerable improvement over the $168.4 million of GAAP net income that it recorded in Q3 of 2020. Arista Networks President and CEO Jayshree Ullal explained that the company’s quarterly results were impressive, especially considering a particular obstacle which many tech firms had to overcome.\\n\\n“Despite a challenging supply chain environment, I am pleased with our delivery of another record quarter of Arista’s financial results in Q3 2021,” Ullal stated.\\n\\nAn Honor From a Technology Giant\\n\\nIn the 2020s, cybersecurity has become a priority for many businesses. The companies in this niche should work together to build up their communities, while helping to keep their clients safe and secure.\\n\\nThere’s actually an association which addresses these specific needs. But not all companies can join it. Just recently, Arista Networks was invited to join the group, which is led by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and known as the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA).\\n\\nMISA can simply be described as an ecosystem of independent software vendors and managed security service providers. However, there’s a community-service aspect to MISA as well, as the association seeks to integrate its members’ solutions to better defend against a world of increasing threats.\\n\\nArista was nominated to join MISA because Arista’s NDR (Network Detection and Response) platform and Microsoft Azure Sentinel have been linked.\\n\\nThe invitation is a major honor for Arista Networks, and it solidifies the company’s relations with Microsoft while also placing Arista into an elite class of cybersecurity-service providers.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThe share split should make ANET stock more enticing for prospective investors. Yet that’s not the only reason to take a position in the stock.\\n\\nAs Arista Networks continues to generate strong revenue growth and maintain close ties with Microsoft, it’s easy to buy and hold the shares with confidence.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nStock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Now Man Who Called Black Monday: “Prepare Now.” #1 EV Stock Still Flying Under the Radar Interested in Crypto?

       " 'Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) continues to march forward with a purpose after a spectacular third quarter. Yet again, it delivered over 50% quarterly revenue growth from the prior-year period. As a result, its stock price is now trading at astronomical levels. Nevertheless, with its rock-solid business model and incredible outlook, this company is tough to ignore. Hence, investors should accumulate NET stock in the dips. Laptop computer displaying logo of Cloudflare (NET)\\n\\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nCloudflare’s growth story has been nothing short of impressive. It has been growing its top line rapidly with amazing net retention rates for the past several quarters. The company has focused on creating a highly scalable and robust network for its users to continue growing on both lines.\\n\\nThe bulls believe that its remarkable customer acquisition validates its strong value proposition. On the flip side, the bears would point out NET shares are trading at nosebleed valuations — they’re at around 100 times forward sales.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle, though, which makes it imperative to examine at this point.\\n\\nCloudflare Had Stellar Third-Quarter Results\\n\\nCloudflare’s rounded off another impressive third quarter. Its revenues of $172 million rose 51% from the prior-year period. Moreover, they also rose over 13% on a sequential basis and comfortably surpassed analyst estimates by $6.65 million. Additionally, Cloudflare broke even on a Non-GAAP basis, and its results came in roughly four cents ahead of analyst estimates.\\n\\n7 Travel Stocks to Pack in Your Portfolio Ahead of Holiday Trips\\n\\nCloudflare has done exceedingly well as a software as a service (SaaS) company, boasting industry-leading measurables. They are the leader of the pack among their peer group, with close to 77% in gross margins. For investors, the scalability of Cloudflare is extremely important as profitability has eluded from the very get-go.\\n\\nThe company has added 170 large customers during the third quarter. Large customers are those that provide over $100,000 in annual recurring revenues. Large customers have risen by over 126% since the first quarter. And, there was a healthy 16% sequential increase from the second to the third quarter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFurthermore, sales aren’t slowing down anytime soon. Cloudflare’s guidance measures are predicting $184 million to $185 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 47% increase on a year-over-year basis. The company expects to break even again on a per-share basis. Cloudflare has been expanding its paying customer base with every passing quarter, especially its large customer base.\\n\\nA New Collaboration, Product and Accolade\\n\\nThere have been a few positive developments for Cloudflare in the past couple of months. Perhaps the most noteworthy was its collaboration with the top search engine companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX).\\n\\nThe goal is to help companies significantly improve their search performances and reduce inefficiencies to deliver timely online experiences. According to Cloudflare’s CEO Mathew Prince: “Since the beginning, we’ve worked to help our customers to give them the speed, reliability, and security they need to do business.”\\n\\nThe company will also be offering an all-new email security suite that effectively integrates with its other solutions. Additionally, Cloudflare beat out its competition and achieved the designation of “Leader” from Forrester’s New Wave for Edge Development Platforms. Cloudflare outpaced industry stalwarts such as Fastly (NASDAQ:FSLY) and Microsoft in every category during the selection process.\\n\\nThe company’s top brass has a tremendous vision to drive the company forward in its objectives. However, NET stock’s valuation remains a concern, and it’s essentially a bet for long-term investors.\\n\\nBottom Line on NET Stock\\n\\nCloudflare never ceases to amaze as it wrapped up another stellar quarter. Revenues and earnings are up by a healthy margin, and it forecasts point to an even more solid fourth quarter.\\n\\nMoreover, it has added several new large customers, which will meaningfully boost its recurring revenues. Yet, NET stock trades a lofty valuation that is too high to ignore.\\n\\nHence, it’s best to wait for short-term dips in the stock to invest in it for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That’s a far cry from the multi-fold gains in peers such as Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc. or Amazon.com Inc. on the NYFANG+ Index. Twitter has also lagged behind the 280% rally for the Nasdaq 100 and the 134% gain in the S&P 500 in that time.\\n\\nWhile the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jensen Huang were all focused “solely on one thing” -- running the company they started -- Dorsey had fingers in more than one pie, said Jim Dixon, an equity sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.\\n\\nA key one has been Square Inc., the digital-payments platform he co-founded and continues to serve as chief executive officer. Unlike Twitter, Square has been a stellar performer in recent years, more than tripling in 2020 alone.\\n\\nSquare’s gains are more typical of founder-led companies. An exchange-traded fund of such firms has risen 134% since its inception in Feb. 2017, outstripping a 99% advance for the S&P 500 Index. Square is the fund’s third-best performer in that time with a gain of more than 2,200%.\\n\\n“Other CEOs, while they may do a good job, aren’t married emotionally to a company the way a founder is,” said Mirabaud’s Dixon.\\n\\nTrade Desk Inc., owner of a platform for buying digital advertisements run by co-founder Jeff Green, is the biggest gainer on the Global X Founder Run Companies ETF after its shares soared more than 30-fold. Other big winners include cybersecurity company Zscaler Inc. and car-retailer Carvana Inc., both up more than 1,800% since the fund’s 2017 inception.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTesla, run by Musk, who is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has jumped more than 2,400% over the same span. Closely held SpaceX hit a valuation of $100 billion with the sale of shares on a secondary market last month.\\n\\nSoftening Software\\n\\nExpensive software stocks have been hit hard in the past two weeks amid rising U.S. treasury yields and a hedge fund exodus.

       " '(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. on Monday became the latest Silicon Valley titan to appoint an Indian-born chief executive officer, joining the likes of Microsoft and Google in recognizing the Asian country as one of the world’s richest pools of tech talent.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nChina Cash Flowed Through Congo Bank to Former President’s Cronies ‘Pension Poachers’ Are Targeting America’s Elderly Veterans Reliving the New York Subway Map Debate\\n\\nThe appointment of former Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal to the top spot at Twitter amplifies the role played by immigrants in the world’s largest technology companies. He joins Satya Nadella of Microsoft Corp., Shantanu Narayen of Adobe Inc., Arvind Krishna of International Business Machines Corp. and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc. among the highest-profile leaders of U.S. firms from Indian origin. Between them, that group of executives pilots companies with a combined market value nearing $5 trillion. Outside of tech, Indra Nooyi led PepsiCo Inc. for 12 years and Ajay Banga is executive chairman of Mastercard Inc. after a decade as CEO.\\n\\nWho is Twitter’s new CEO? Learn more about Parag Agrawal\\n\\nLike his Valley compatriots, Agrawal comes from a technical background and worked his way up within the company. At age 37, he’s the youngest CEO of any S&P 500 firm. Agrawal got his engineering degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, which as the country’s premier tech college has spawned generations of prominent politicians and corporate leaders, including Pichai and Krishna. He secured a foothold in Silicon Valley after moving onto Stanford University for his doctorate in computer science.\\n\\n“Being an Indian is a big advantage now, people expect us to be good engineers and good managers,” said Vivek Wadhwa, a Distinguished Fellow at Harvard Law School and the author of a book profiling Nadella’s rise at Microsoft. “From what I know, Parag Agrawal shares Satya’s values and has a similar management style.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTwitter co-founder and outgoing CEO Jack Dorsey endorsed Agrawal’s technical capabilities as “transformational” in his note upon stepping down. But it’ll be the new leader’s skill in navigating thorny issues like free speech, race relations and relationships with governments that will soon be tested.\\n\\nIn a rare interview a year ago, Agrawal described Twitter’s method of dealing with misinformation as “an increasingly nuanced approach with a range of interventions.” Echoing Dorsey’s long-held emphasis on trying to keep Twitter a neutral platform, he added that “we attempt to not adjudicate truth, we focus on potential for harm.”\\n\\nIn his country of birth, where Twitter has nearly 20 million users, Agrawal’s company has come under attack from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on several fronts. The administration there has criticized its reluctance to take down messages of support for farmer protests and its handling of tweets by leaders on both sides of the political divide. Twitter serves a similar role in the domestic political discourse as it does in the U.S., with Modi’s account alone having a following of 73 million.\\n\\nElevating Agrawal will help, according to Wadhwa. “Jack’s arrogance turned many governments off,” he said. “If you note how Microsoft has not been the target of the left or right in the U.S., it is because of Satya and his ability to listen to criticism and maintain a balance. I expect that Agrawal will do the same.”\\n\\nTo date, Agrawal has maintained a low profile and his experience has concentrated in product development and market research. He was named Twitter’s first distinguished engineer for his role in helping boost audience growth and revenue before becoming CTO. Now CEO, he’ll find navigating a friendlier course with India essential to expanding those goals of widening Twitter’s reach. The country is already the biggest user base for Meta Platforms Inc.’s WhatsApp with half a billion users, Alphabet’s YouTube has nearly as big an audience and Twitter counts it among its fastest-growing markets.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t Helping Wildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the Benefits\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       " '(Bloomberg) -- By naming Parag Agrawal as chief executive officer, Twitter Inc. is turning inward, choosing a low-profile technologist to steer a social network that has underperformed the market, haltingly introduced new products, and struggled to moderate harmful content under a leader long criticized for divided attention.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nChina Cash Flowed Through Congo Bank to Former President’s Cronies ‘Pension Poachers’ Are Targeting America’s Elderly Veterans Reliving the New York Subway Map Debate\\n\\nAgrawal, 37, was named on Monday to succeed co-founder Jack Dorsey after a four-year stint as CTO, a role where he oversaw Twitter’s pursuit of blockchain and other decentralized technologies. Dorsey, 45, will remain on the board through the summer and will stay at the helm of Square Inc., the payments company he also co-founded.\\n\\nWhile Dorsey is a billionaire celebrity with famous friends and millions of Twitter followers, Agrawal is still a relative unknown who has spent no time in the limelight at the controversial social media company. Dorsey’s personal interests -- like music and Bitcoin -- often made an appearance in his posts, and eventually made their way onto the company’s product road map, but he has fallen short of transforming the business since he took over for his second stint as CEO in 2015.\\n\\nThe company’s new chief will inherit Twitter’s political scuffles -- including criticism over its ban on former President Donald Trump as well as friction with India’s ruling party. And he’ll have to chase aggressive goals to step up user growth, double revenue and expedite product execution.\\n\\n“What’s going to be his North Star that he puts out there to kind of bet the farm -- or at least his career -- on?” said Mark Shmulik, an equity research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “And then how successful will he be at delivering against that?”\\n\\nAgrawal is the youngest person to run a company in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prior to his move to Twitter, Agrawal earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay and a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHe has worked as a researcher for Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and AT&T Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Twitter in 2011 as an engineer at a time when the company had fewer than 1,000 employees. In that role, he worked on boosting audience growth and revenue and was named Twitter’s first distinguished engineer, the company said. After being named CTO in 2017, he led the company’s technical strategy including overseeing advancements in machine learning, according to Twitter’s website.\\n\\nNow Agrawal takes over a company that has been slow to roll out new products and features for years, but has started to move faster, make more acquisitions and push into areas that might expand the business, like live audio and subscriptions.\\n\\nTwitter’s accelerated targets for growth were put in place after activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a stake in early 2020 to pressure the company to jump-start its business. After making initial changes that satisfied Elliott in 2020, in February 2021 Twitter announced goals to double annual revenue by 2023, and to continue to grow its user base by 20% each of the next three years.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Agrawal’s appointment means Twitter will have a full-time CEO for the first time in years. Dorsey’s position as leader of Square was one of Elliott’s main criticisms of the social network. On Monday, Agrawal sent a message to fellow Twitter employees, alluding to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\\n\\n“We recently updated our strategy to hit ambitious goals, and I believe that strategy to be bold and right,” Agrawal wrote. “But our critical challenge is how we work to execute against it and deliver results -- that’s how we’ll make Twitter be the best it can be for our customers, shareholders, and for each of you.”\\n\\nInsider reaction to the news appears mixed. A poll on Blind, an anonymous app for employees who sign up with a company email address, found that more than three-quarters of the more than 150 respondents either didn’t believe Agrawal was “the guy” for the job, or were waiting to decide but “feeling negative.” Some other employee tweets were more positive, and many acknowledged that the CEO transition already appears smoother than the last time Twitter changed leaders.\\n\\nTwitter shareholders will be looking to Agrawal to chart a steadier course toward building up the company’s revenue and engagement metrics. While Twitter’s user base has been expanding steadily for years, the company has failed to match the growth or stock returns of peers like Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. Twitter stock has climbed 62% since Dorsey’s return in 2015, and annual revenue is up 68% from the 2015 level. Meta’s stock has gained 260% in that same time, and sales have more than quadrupled.\\n\\nRivals’ investments in augmented and virtual reality-powered devices and services could put pressure on Twitter to innovate in a bolder and quicker way. Meta recently changed its name to signal its focus on immersive digital worlds known as the metaverse, which many big tech companies are chasing as the next transformational computing platform.\\n\\n“The headline takeaway here is Twitter’s execution,” said Mandeep Singh, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “The level of engagement they had, they never were able to monetize it as well as some of the other social media platforms.”\\n\\nTo stay competitive, Agrawal may need to change the company’s culture so that new products and strategies can be implemented at a quicker pace than in years past, Shmulik argued.\\n\\n“Can he at least avoid being the cog that everything needs to go through to get approvals and to get things moving?” Shmulik said. “Can he give more autonomy to different parts of the org so they can move at a quicker pace?”\\n\\nAgrawal won’t just need to keep growing Twitter’s business. The company also remains at the center of a number of thorny political issues, such as how to moderate speech on the internet, and has been a prime target for conservative politicians who believe tech companies have too much power.\\n\\nTwitter is routinely criticized by politicians around the world over how it chooses to manage misinformation, hate speech and other forms of objectionable content on its sprawling social network, which has 211 million daily active users. It’s become the go-to social media platform where politicians turn to trade barbs, where CEOs announce new products, and everyday users talk about the latest events.\\n\\nThe widespread reach of Twitter also makes it a place with many polarizing viewpoints, and the company is often attacked for decisions it makes around policing content. It’s accused of censorship by those whose tweets are removed or marked with a warning, and criticized by others for failing to protect its users from abuse or hate speech when it leaves some posts up.\\n\\nThis difficult balance is one reason the company has pushed what it calls Bluesky, an open-source project that aims to decentralize the technology used to run social media platforms. In theory, different organizations would have the freedom to create their own rules and algorithms to govern social media. A post that might violate Twitter’s rules, and thus be removed, could be visible on another service using the same protocol but with more lenient content standards. Agrawal understands Bluesky as well as any executive at Twitter, having helped incubate the idea internally before Twitter appointed an external lead for the project.\\n\\nSo far, Twitter’s approach to content moderation has yet to squelch criticism from Washington’s lawmakers, who have routinely hauled Dorsey before Congress to testify about the company’s policies. That outside pressure from politicians and pundits will be a stark change for Agrawal, who has spent his time at Twitter far from the spotlight.\\n\\nAgrawal is getting a crash course on what it’s like to be a high-profile CEO. Shortly after he was announced as Dorsey’s successor, some Twitter users pounced on a 2010 tweet of his, quoting a Daily Show joke about how treating all Muslims as terrorists was analogous to treating all White people as racists.\\n\\nDorsey will stay on the board of San Francisco-based Twitter until his term expires in 2022, the company said. Agrawal is also joining the board, and director Bret Taylor, who is chief operating officer of software maker Salesforce.com Inc., was named independent chairman.\\n\\nThough Agrawal may not ever cut as public a profile as his predecessor, as CEO he will be required to forge new relationships with the press, regulators and even his own employees.\\n\\n“The world is watching us right now, even more than they have before,” Agrawal wrote Monday. “It’s because they care about Twitter and our future, and it’s a signal that the work we do here matters.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t Helping Wildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the Benefits\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.']"
